You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Hi.
do you listen to this crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Queen Harry?
Hi, Joey.
What do you think?
Let go!
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Never
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
She kissed me.
Two legs, nice rack...
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Are you lost?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Who?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
You hate me don't you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Okay?
Who?
No, you weren't
Oh, so now you think you know me?
What are you doing here?
You 're so --
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
A soft side? Who knew?
State trooper?
No one else knows
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Oh huh
What?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Say it
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
What did they say about Granada before today?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thank you.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What's your cut?  How much?
No.  No way.
What about back home?
Is he your boyfriend?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who do you think, Chief?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
Are you hit?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, why should you?
Hmmmm.
This isn't homicide school.
You goin' to the escort service?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Of course.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Alright.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Tonight.
Ready?
You stuff sausage in it.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Where's your partner?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
What is that?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Credit?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Okay. 
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
But not completely inconceivable?
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Are you quite sure?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
What's the matter with my place?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here you go, baby.
You here to write my life story?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You made that move, huh?
Must be billy's girl.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Which one pulled the trigger?
What a screw-up.
That's what you say, Cates...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
A cop...
When? How?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Hey...
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
You want to go outside?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...would you like a drink?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
You noticed...
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
It means, "Never without my permission".
What are you doing?
What's she doing?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
The Fifth Element...
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
To save the world.
I'm not going.
Why not?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Here we go again...
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
Options.
...Not far, now.
How's our deal coming along?
Welcome home.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
What happened to you?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
There's nothing harder.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
You said something about money.
And they are?
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Where's that?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
We do.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
I know what you did.
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Why?
Stop talking.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
That's right.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is he, his name?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
No.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You're joking.
Hello?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We're all like that.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
What?
Do you think the police did a good job?
Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Those are her belongings.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
None too discreet, is he?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
Is there something we can do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Here we are.
You look great!
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
How did you know that?
Dad!
But Dad --
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
You do good work, Alice.
But I've seen her grave.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Huh?
I think you're right.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I plan to. Soon.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yeah.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
In the chest.
Do what?
Was it funny?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Where's the plow?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
How you holding up, Wade?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Could be.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
It's just...
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
How?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Jack?
Where... how'd you hear that?
Love! I'm made of love!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
That it wasn't an accident.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Some kids were teasing you?
Yes dear?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
You read my mind.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
How we doing, Colonel?
I prefered the terrorists.
We're not going to make it.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Leave my daughter alone.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Finally, we can bargain.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Can't it wait?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Thank you for calling the white House...
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Did you feel that?
Dunn.
If that's the way you want it.
Set!
I mean for Ted.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Have you got it straightened out now?
My career is shot.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Negative.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You've been hurt.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Both pilots!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
And a little ice.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Ted...
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Yes, Captain?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Oh, I'd love to.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Yes...
Kill them both.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Screw you.
Your mother mates out of season.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Please, I must get out here.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
We all did.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Yeah, I heard of it.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Yes, Hicks?
...We're coming in.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
They'll get us.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Locked.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Why not?
No, it's different, honey.
Are we going to sleep now?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Good morning.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Humiliated?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
What is it?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
What's the matter with you?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
You're not going to do this?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
I can't write it!
Excellency!
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
It is miraculous.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Who was your teacher?
A-flat, Majesty.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
What? On one hearing only?
What do you mean, Sire?
Twenty-six.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
It couldn't be better.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
German!
Wolfi!
Love, Sire!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
What exactly are you working on?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
How could I not?
You flatter me.
What dead? Who is dead?
Are you neglecting my request?
This is only a vaudeville.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
The Fire.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
And that's all?
That's wonderful!
Because His Majesty wishes it.
No, but I'm the best.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Leave me alone.
Well?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Do you believe it?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Yes.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
He's here.
Yes, Doctor.
Shall I send a car?
What shall we do?
It was a wolf.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Call me Alex.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I was. What are you reading?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Hello. You all right?
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Are you better now?
It's nice to see you.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
David, what are you doing?
What?
David, don't lose control.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I looked.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Two weeks?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
She's a jerk.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Beware the moon?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
What's the plan?
Yeah.
You really scared me, you shithead.
David!
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Nurse!
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Yes?
What here?
Do you have any hot soup?
Hello, Tom.
Matt?
Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Yes.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Happy now?
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Yes?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Well, I—
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Why pick on him ?
If he can do it, yes.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Is it safe?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
What did you do with it?
Oh, Matt . . .
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Then who changed it?
This is healing?
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
I swear --
Nope.
How many of them did he kill?
Hey!
Beg pardon?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Ride with me, cousin?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
What is wrong with you?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
I got seven thousand.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Strategically.
You 'um big lawman?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
My little Web did that?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
They're gone. What are you --
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
You're doing just fine.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah Jimmy?
Easterners.
Riders --
You shouldn't be up.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Let the law --
We're moving you tomorrow.
Mmm.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
That's what I would have done.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
THEN WHO DID?!
Parker.
What is that?
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
I demand action.
Can't you tell me anything?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
In English, Pinkerton.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
I know. Stop it.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
J&B. Straight.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Is it a what?
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I haven't seen you around here.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Yes, darling?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
How did you guess?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you sure?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
What...is...it?
Patrick?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Oh, something. . romantic?
You don't like this, I take it?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
What's that?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Patrick Bateman's office.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Well...
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
You sure?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Hang...out?
Don't you know this?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
That's not the information I've received.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Listen, what's your name?
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What!
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
They hack into people's programs?
You can't just walk in, either.
...Whaddo I do?
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Milo?
That'll be a test, won't it?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Cool!
Would you like a Coke or something?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
I do!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
...You wanna work -- here?
Lisa.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
They'd frame him.
...Milo?
A what?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Thank God.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
I don't know.
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other?
What?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Be careful.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Well, you can't always get what you want.
That does not compute.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I beg your pardon?
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I'm sure.
Why?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Why?
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Do you think she's prettier than I?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Likewise.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Noooooooooooooo!
Shut up.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
My son?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
I don't want to.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
I'm proud of you.
What about his teeth?
... bottle ...
Red ...
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
What are you trying to do to me?
We want to help...!
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Too many cooks --
Valentine, listen to me ...
Much better.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Any other vices?
I wasn't about to.
What on earth?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Because you always obey orders ...
You're playing games.
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I told Mother I took care of you.
You lied.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Privately owned by ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Weather's turning nasty.
This man -- did you see him?
Guilty until proven innocent?
You're kidding.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
I've tried to change her mind.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
A real turd.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
I just want to be alone.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Are any of those right?
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Under the table!
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
How'd it go?
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Wash it to the windows?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Goddamn it Stephen!
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- What were they doing there?
Jennifer.
Really? No kidding.
With grenadine, right?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
You think that's really any of your business?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
-- Shhh.
But the right guess on this is arson.
Did you pull me out?
So what do you want me to do?
Four months?
No need to be modest, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Fireman shit?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Okay.
He works for me.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Nah...
You took the chalice.
I forgive you.
Are you sure?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
So that's what you been doing?
You're in this up till ya neck.
And I'm the feet.
What do I have to do?
To what?
Four minutes ago.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Go away, unless you got my money.
How did you end up here?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
How long has my father been like this?
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
You've said that already.
So you have your small victory, now what?
Please don't go there.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, your father called.
Yes he did.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
No.
Not at all?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I heard ya lady is wild.
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Never read a book in my whole life.
You're sure this is a good idea.
And what?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
What is the service, sir?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Why are you shaking?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Yes!
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Bill Styles...
You framed-him...
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
I asked for a policeman.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
I apologize --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
What is that?
Something like that. You?
You're kidding.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Little bit.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Four --
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
He was your friend.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
But you didn't see it, right?
Fifty minutes.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Tell him to shut up --
This is totally unnecessary --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
What did she look like?
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I can.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
Did I ever tell you about how...
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad!
What?
Where are we headed?
Wait! I need those!
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Yes.
That's because most of it never happened.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
What for?
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Do you want to stop?
And...
So?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It is too judgmental.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Excuse me?
We'll pretend it never happened.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Please, there's no... Oh.
What?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I don't want anyone to die.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
You take her to a doctor?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
You liked what I brung ya?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Can I put it in your mouth?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Don't... don't say that to me...
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Why you got me chained?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
In my house, you watch that lip...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
What is it?
Looks like you know a song.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
He tapped that.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
The hell is this shit?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Let's go.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Connie...
Give me a break, would you?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Gaiijin.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
Start it.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Ich said you left.
I need someone to translate for me.
How big a package we talking about?
Why me?
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
You trust me?
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
What's the problem?
Also extraordinary things.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Show me something?
You could help us.
When do you deliver your project?
What's going on down there?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Well, when do you get paid?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Next.
Vodka!
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Sorry.
During the road test...
Too old.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Me.
I'd take him to the doctor.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I've already got more help than I need.
I can imagine.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Bad?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
She didn't know?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
How do you know I'm not?
What's your name?
Pris.
Just better.
Yes?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Are you French?
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
What?
Two weeks.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Two weeks.
Of course.
Um-hum.
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Really?
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
But, Eve, I would--
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
How do I leave here?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
That's what everybody believes?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Yeah.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Why not? He has great pants.
The recovery is very impressive.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
So, did you buy a movie?
Thirty-five.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I do alright.
Dad!
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Yes, ma'am.
We have to go.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
We stay down here.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, I am the head of this household--
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
I don't know.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
I don't know. I like to think so.
We came back to the house!
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Yes.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
The criminals are winning.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Never before this.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Frank is coming?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Bull.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Who's this fuck?
Those are my breasts.
There ya go.
Do you want the car?
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Am I bothering you?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I've gotta go in.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Alright.
What's the plan.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
He got a little jealous.
Actually. I've been in twice.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You like mysteries that much?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
Where to?
You want to dance?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
You think they sold me out? No way.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Anybody see ya?
Yeah, well...
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Yeah, we promise.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Would someone please come over here and...
Hey Murphy?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I don't know they just always need it.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Aye.
Nine bodies.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Of course they were. How many?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
It was... It was...
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Greeks. The Italians.
What about one guy with two guns?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Who the...
Chief, what the fuck is this?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
What are you serious?
Hello?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Worst day of my life, man.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hello? You there?
You know them personally?
Father, I'll do you right here.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
This is he?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Where's the other stocker?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Why not?
Well, then cut it in half.
What about them?
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
What the fuck is going on here?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, now we've got a plan.
This was in fourth grade.
He's gone. He stole the car.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
He doesn't want to fight.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I'll see you there.
Yeah.
You think Applejack knew?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
What's he in for?
No. I'm not.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I don't want to die.
No. Bob did.
This is good.
Absolutely.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Could you grow cinnamon?
Let them fight.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
You think I'm improving?
Yeah.
No.
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
I don't know about that.
That never would of --
OK, Bob.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Bob.
He electrocuted someone?
What are you doing?
This is natural.
You really think he'll remember you?
I told you they were there.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I know it, man. Hang on.
I couldn't hear anything.
Applejack drove.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Can't get it. It won't... 
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You like Chicanos?
You Hoto?
Come on in!
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Treadstone.
And what are we looking for?
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Berlin!
What?
Did he say anything to you?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I emptied it.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
But we were so careful.
He was at the campground yesterday.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
What do you mean?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Where am I?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Looks like he's been detained.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
I'll wait... back there.
Rest, William.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
They're coming!
Good to see you again.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I have faced him. Have you?
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
You scare me.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
You have... you have a husband.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
We can't stop!
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
I know, but...
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Which is?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
I thought I was the bad guy!
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He did. Captain Renault did.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
And I said I would never leave you.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
He suggested I ask you.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Everything in order?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
I understand.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
We'll be there.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
I was misinformed.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Is that a serious offer?
He is traveling with a lady.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Boss, let's get out of here.
What's that you're playing?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Get up.
Do too much, I'll die.
No.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
No.
I got married.
I know.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Is that Jango?
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
What happened to your pants?
What about the sender?
You what?
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
How many months are you?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
A movie *outside*?
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please don't...
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
*Liver* killed him?
Did you grow up around here?
Did you bite it?
Have you enlisted?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
What about the trees?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
What business is you in, Homer?
First pregnancy?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
It look nicer then home!
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
The standard ten.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Guess so.
Ten is standard, sir.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Why?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
He was looking out for you.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Is it all fugasi?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Sorry. What?
Can't say.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
That's it?
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
Maybe another time.
You're shaking.
What?!
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
I'm working on that soccer story.
I'll try and make it.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Good night?
I. sold the car.
I've got something to tell you.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
What about a drink on the way home?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
I hope it brings you luck.
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
So how are you doing, dad?
I've lived there.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I know that. But you can now.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm sorry.
Did you solve your problems?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Hey Jack, join us.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
What happened to Bella?
Where did you go to school?
Why four? And not three or five?
I make it six.
Ever?
You can start Monday week.
I just want the job.
What flickering light?
What the hell?
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's it.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
What?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
You know what I think about, Talby?
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Doolittle, hello?
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Sir?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
That's a lotta crap.
Why would I be pissed?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Who is...
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
You lost me.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Your basic hodge-podge.
You said you could help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
What's this?
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
Who is it?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Thank you.
As long as you're okay.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Who are you?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Thanks, miss.
More than anything in the world.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
What are you, high?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Any luck?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Whoa... she just farted.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
No... You don't think...?
Dude, this is all I got.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Yeah, you did!
Good morning...
Good MORNING!
Yeah.
Dr. Monnitoff?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
When can I squeeze one out?
I didn't say shit.
Dea ex machina...
Don't look so freaked.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
Will you go with me?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's alright... I understand.
Are you okay?
So, we call them... IMGs.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
So how was school today?
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
He said to follow him.
Yes.
Four times... so far.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
I know.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But you were punished.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Yeah.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
It is a big deal.
Rose.
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Kitty...
No more fuckin' for her.
Is Mom okay?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Really, Loretta?
Loretta, never have kids.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Loretta, don't do that.
I gotta work with these women.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Go on! Get out!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Yes...
I know.
Okay... well, bye.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Ohio...
What?
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
This is -- what?
I will if you shut your piehole.
And wear a crown and everything.
Who to?
"My dear President"...
Here I am, Father...
Send for my car...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Yes, sir. 
Have you got a license?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I don't remember.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Oh, would you...?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I feel much better. Thank you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
Oh no?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Mmmerrick.
...Yes potatoes... but...
How is your tea, John?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You did this for me?
Yes, very soon.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
I've heard.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Very smart indeed.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
What are what?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I... but I...
The second note.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Well you started it.
Louder.
Why should you care?
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
What did he say?
Why should WE care?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Bye, Leif.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Well, of course he is!
Dad!
Well... I'm game.
I remember.
Oh, Tangerine.
What's wrong with me?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Where do you live?
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
So you like bookstores, huh?
You like that?
Yeah?
I don't know.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yeah, I guess.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Oh, thank God. It's going.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
What?
Happy Birthday.
Yeah.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
You said...
You know what I did.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Oh, um...
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
I don't know.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
What?
So you don't mind?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Definitely!
Stan... c'mon...
You found us okay?
Mary...
How do you mean?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We can't do this.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Just wanted to let you know.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Siwash, huh?
Is everything getting worse?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
How does she like what in bed?
What do you think?
Hitchhiking?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Holy shit...
Time to play Spam in the can.
Coop, where are you...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
What does?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
We've got pressure.
Peters...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Carbon dioxide?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
What?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Keep him talking.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
Relax, it's casual.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
What are you doing here?
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Are you alright?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
No more cracks about how I look.
What do you mean "complete"?
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Now what is up with that?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
And if he's not...?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Yes, thanks.
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben did this?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
It's the first door on your left!
They're not home yet.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
Leave me alone!
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
What? Are you all right?
Did you get her name?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Did you go home and get it?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Yes.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
How's it going.
Don't you like him?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Do you think guys find that attractive?
What variables?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
What's Doug do in Chicago?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
That little prick.
Where's Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
That's a nice shirt.
What about those other guys you live with?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
What happened? What did they do to her?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
Jesus! Did I say that?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Shoot it.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
No, she's looking for you.
Where'd you get this?
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
We can't risk letting them in.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Who the hell would you call?
Where's that?
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
You got something better?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And the rest of 'em?
And that's how I ended up here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Your parents of relation?
We're going to get help.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Um-hmmm.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
Huh?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I wouldn't do that, son.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Shit!
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Let's go!
Oh my God... What is that?
We should stick together out there.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Um, well...
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Frances?  Oh no.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Oh. I mean, good.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Hi Frances, got a minute?
My clothes?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I'm not!
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Huh.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Showdown.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
I know you believe that.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll get you home, Frances.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Really?
Thank you, Ralph.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
Please, Francie...
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Then don't go to Hollywood.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Where to?
Yeah. I don't know.
No.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
I'm not!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
How long will you be?
Mama...?
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Don't I know you?
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
...Did you really say that?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No! No!
What?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You're an outcast.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Materials. Nothing more.
Why... her?
You will honor your promise to me!
I will not! Kill me now!
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
I've no choice
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Professor?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Thank you, Henry.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Philosophical?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Why?
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Do you share my madness?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
We should go now.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
Oh, my God...
How come?
Sure.
Ha!
Jack?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Don't call him.
Cowboy.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
That's thirty percent.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What about Kate?
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
In the Winnebago.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
About two hours from now.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Creepy guy.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
-- you got your microwave --
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
He says you were scratching.
Start the car.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
How's it feel?
Cops.
You okay?
What?
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Thank you, ensign.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Across the board, sir.
Permission to leave, sir?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
White House boys want a private meeting.
Did you hear?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
You know him.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
I'd sure like to know who.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Who the hell are all these people?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
And you think this creature is one of them?
I got pretty close.
How do you know?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Really? A girlfriend then?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Why are you telling this to me?
Well good, that's very... nice.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Don't speak, Quellek.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
You go first! There's no time!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Alex you can't -just leave.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
What?  Up?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
What's the weather like outside?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
U.... What do you think?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
...The digital conveyor.
I am SO SICK of being right.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
You're playing your good side.
Right.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Yes.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
NO, Thank God he has not.
Commander...
Mathesar? What is that?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Wh... Where are we?
Excuse me?
NO NO NO.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
We've got powder but no ball!
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
They are... friends of Congress.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They help me understand why we fight.
The man is a traitor!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
You know very well who it is that I love.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Or, 'civilized'.
Then why are you teaching me...?
What are you doing?
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
You see the paper?
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
Your who?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
She's... young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
I need the money.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
I'll find it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
What?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
He owes me money.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
That's what I'm doing.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
Once.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
So you want to know.
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
We call you a taxi.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
...That's what we finally decided.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Sounds fair.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
You bet.
Be quiet and listen.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Let's not be too hasty.
What day is it?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
A what?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
I think you know.
The radio!
What the fuck -- ?
What's slow?
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
The guy. He just came this way.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Epps.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
Collision? With what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
What happened.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
What happened?
Say what?
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Will you get off my back for once?
How should I know?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
What?
About what?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Well, yes...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
So, where's "Weird Al"?
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Jesus, look at this guy.
Are you the one who left that note?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Good.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I remember every minute of that party.
What does it stand for?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Look, maybe that's him!
It's obviously him!
This is way too creepy.
Gross!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Not really...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
What was that all about?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Where did you get that?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I don't believe you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
A what?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Yes.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
I - I'd really rather not...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Jesus...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
That's the spirit!
Aren't you going to get that?
Oh, hi...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
I... I don't think so.
What's up?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
That slut!
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
You were contracted to work-
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
No hints, Samuel.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
I am a man of peace.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
We have hunted since childhood.
Don't much like them.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
But you said they were always old.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
That's very considerate.
Have you got it?
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
We don't have a relationship.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
His name is Oscar.
That's where the buggy stopped.
You're really good, you know.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Command me, lord.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Get on with it, counselor!
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
From where -- Neptune?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Who?
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
What happened?
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Huh?  What?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Now where are you going?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
No?  What do I act like?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Did you see it?  What was it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.
I want you to have this. 
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Why do you want to see it?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
What?
Does she want to be?
Where's the Keymaster?
Gozer.
What now?
What is it?
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
No sense worrying about it now.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
That's difficult to say, general.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
God of passages and changes?
But have never been?
You're hearing about somebody else.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you play at being drunk?
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
So I understand.
They're studying with Cynics.
Narcissus!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
You teach them!
Who the hell are you?
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
No, I couldn't.
What's the matter?
Elaine --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
I don't understand --
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Please let me go.
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
I don't understand.
I don't know.
We just can.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
No, Benjamin.
You're not one of those agitators?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What did you do to her?
Where are you?
What?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
In general.
What?
Will you take me home?
When is he coming back?
Drink?
What do you think of me?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Oh my God.
Pardon?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
What are you so scared of?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I want to say something first.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
How are you?
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Now?
Benjamin.
Yes?
To tell you?
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Is this -- what?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
What novel did you read.
What?
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
What was your major?
Oh my God.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
But why shouldn't I?
Well, I'm not.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
If that's how you feel --
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
I'll find her.
Sir?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
-- worried?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
No.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
I know.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Now look -- please --
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
HUH?
The Carlsons' are here.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I've quit.
I'll pay you back.
How?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Very little.
What?
You're very funny --
I'd given you up.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I want to be alone --
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
And now?
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Bless you...
On the train?
Yes, quite.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
No, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
Oh!
You're tired. I can see that.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
What?
Moreover --
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Movies?
You...
Can't you understand me?
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh, no.
Why not?
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Your what?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You ever hear about the oranges?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Roy? He's always crying.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
It's not your fault.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Sounds like a good Idea.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
I like those.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I've really got to --
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
You're getting off the grift?
That's right.
I don't?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
This time...
You're too young. You should be in school.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Her job.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
The tap. What you do for a living.
I thought these people were broke.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
That's what I say.
) What?
You watch that mouth.
Gun?
What?
That's that, then.
Well, when you put it that way.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
That's it?
Carter.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Carter.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Forget it.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
Get on the bus.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Not me.
I came to see you.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
It's always John.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Hey, you alright?
Michael Meyers.
Keri, you all right?
What is it?
Shit, Linda!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Mommy, I'm scared.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Yes?
How all the magazines show tits today.
I suppose.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Let's talk about it some other time.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
I dunno, boy.
What's funny about that?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
You never played a violin.
You did?
How are you, honeybunch?
I forget mine for years on end.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Our pleasure.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I've considered that.
Fifty years?
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
For what?
What went wrong?
As a matter of fact--
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
College!
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Tell me that.
Mhravitch.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Disease?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
I have a brain.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
It couldn't!
No you're not!
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
Two hundred years old.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Rifle?
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I mean it!
How do I load?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
With spittle?
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
More clowning!  Don't you see?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
New lives begin!
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Alice got married again.
Alice is dead?
Who's dead?
What happened?
I'm only ten years old.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Premature ejaculation.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Not true.
A lot of people don't.
That man is your father.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I'm glad.
Coming.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
How long has this been going on?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
That's the XKE.
It's suicide!
Why would you do that?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
No. I don't think so.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
I just want to ask some questions.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
You want a tip?
I'm getting angry.
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
That's all you got, three girls?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
What's that shade of blue called?
Are you sure it's all right?
The other girl is the star?
You know her?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Of Joanne's?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
What's T-J?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Well, what do they know?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
They are?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
I'm only human, you know.
What are you doing here?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Is Marsha there?
What plan?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where does he hang out?
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
You're talking about real excitement?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Hold it, mister.
I don't know.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
None of that, lady.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Eh, fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
What do you think?
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
But I don't play anything.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
With God?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
You should have been a poet.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
At a funeral.
Do you play?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Harold?
Then why did you leave?
No.  I'd have liked to.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Jeez! That's a great story,
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Well, I didn't.
It's different for us.
He... he loved me.
She's done it.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
I'm scared.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I... remember.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Don't look! Turn around.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
We're on the move.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Yes?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Red, I --
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Please. Get back into bed.
Oh Christ.
No.
This isn't happening.
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
I'm very happy.
Tell me who you are.
Hurting.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
What kind of doors?
So you were cheated.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I said no.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
All right.
Where are you?
Why not?
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Dead.
Why don't you do the same?
Where are you?
You'd like the house.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Sure.
I have to talk to you.
You're not going?
I've been better.
Can I lend you a hand?
What did I say?
'Bye.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
What's up?
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I have all of the others.
I have a television.
Who are you going to see?
Don't do it, Rob!
Oh, hi.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Great.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
I dunno.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
We'll talk some other time.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I don't have your number.
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
You know I'm a good person.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
I don't want to go back.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hi.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Hello?  Anybody there?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
It's my birthday.
He was unsual.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Would you remember his name?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have friends.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
No one knows you're here?
You're wrong.
Yes.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
A factor of age.
I hope I never get that old.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That would be difficult to explain.
I didn't kill the watchman.
What about that family in '31?
Don't.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What is it?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
The inheritance.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Who is it?
I don't believe him.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Stop.
I did at that.
Pheasant.
You're a long way from Inverness.
You feel you know me.
You are still so very young.
This can't be.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Of course.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Must he go?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
What's the point?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
No.
What are you getting at?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
No.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Seventy-five.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
But --
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Did you finish the interview?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Where'd she go?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Anything the matter?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
The money? Why?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
What do you want?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Sure you can. Come on.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Dead?
Please! Will you just --
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Allow me.
You said it.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I know, but --
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Is he coming back here?
Double-crossing swine!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Walter, you can't do that!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, that about covers everything.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Boy, did you see her go?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
What do I know about Williams?
He's harmless.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
What?
That's a lie!!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Now, Hildy --
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Phone for you, Hildy.
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
You fight it cut.
Look out, you --
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
They're not human!
Quiet, Mollie!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
No, I don't think so.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
I know.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Sod.
You wouldn't.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
They've got the real thing outside.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Naturally.
And absent bridegrooms!
Has Sue got it right?
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
The ideas you get in your head.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Up to six weeks, I think.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
What about R.J.?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
But if you did.
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
She looks like she stinks.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Come on, get with the facts.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
Sorry.
I suggest you kids leave now.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
You decide. Today is your day.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Is everything fine?
Oui.
Yes. Happy happy.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Please. I look a mess.
You were wonderful!
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Really?
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Paper or cloth?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
That's great.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Give me a bottle of beer.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
We'll be there.
What is?
That's your problem.
A thousand.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
How're the hands?
I wanna walk.
I'm a businessman, kid.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
He's my partner.
Why?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
I told you you'd get your money back.
Oh yeah? Where?
Aw, Eddie.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Long wait for a bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Do you want me to go?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You glad?
What is it, Eddie?
What do you want to tell me?
Oh, grow up.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
He went off someplace.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Very good shot.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Why don't you start with me?
That's who you are too, Emma.
Shhh... don't talk.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Yes.
... and Rigel.
What did it look like?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Is that all he said?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
What happened?
That signal. It's a countdown.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Pops!
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Pops, you're a genius!
We're loose!
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
And our troops here?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
It had been deemed classified.
You're late.
Was his father stationed here?
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Why did you people come here?
Peace? No peace.
Venice, Italy!
Dad was onto something here!
How's the head?
Yes. Now we know.
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Are you expected?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No?
What are you going to do?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
You came back for the book? Why?
Out!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Look, can we discuss this later?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Brody's this way.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Nice landing.
It's a new experience for me.
This is intolerable!
I'll take the camels.
No.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
You have insulted my son.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Let up on the brake!
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
That's far enough!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Don't catch cold.
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Yes.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
I get it!
Where are you,...Al?
Who?
Yes?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
No.
Me? What'd I do?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Why he's argumentative?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
I'll tell you what to say.
Now what?
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know...To get Al.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Corridor A.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
You eat it.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
He recognises you, throw him off.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
I don't know!
Don't you think I stand out like this.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
What next!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Dieter!
This may hurt.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
You're a lucky man.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What abilities...?
How about a deal?
They took the tapes.
What Job?
It is to me too.
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
I will?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
You did.
How often they come here?
No, he didn't do that.
I'm leaving too.
Hiroshima.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Hong Kong.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Are you alright?
They asked about you.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Why are you on to him?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Is there anything else?
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Ow?...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Where?
Sure. Where?
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Shit...
I don't know what he was thinking.
Sure.
Good.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
Come again?
Hi, baby.
That's my stuff from the office...
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
No, you do not.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
No shit.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Who's that?
Did work.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Next to your father?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
Yes.
They do this with impunity!
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
You greased the rails!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I can't say that!
What are you talking about?
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form!
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Jail?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Got any symptoms?
He's the wrong man.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I want to nail you ass.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Income tax evasion?
Forgery and Fraud?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
He was right, wasn't he?
Wow.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
Yes?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I'm not sure.
Nothing?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Three is not Farrow.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Warne?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
The reward.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
We'll go into that some other time.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
You ought to know why. Because—
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
I don't know.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Why; naturally, I—
What do they say?
Amateurs!
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
No.
Whadda you want!
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Yes.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
What for?
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Yes.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
This looks like the best spot.
Well, take them off.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
know—but—
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Nope.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Whatever you say, darling.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Huh?
Well, I got it, Joe.
What?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
What do you reckon that's for?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Mebbe.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
There's a seat over there for you.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
What's up?
Thanks. 
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
No, I'm not...
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
What's the other name?
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
And then Sunday?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
I wouldn't imagine where.
David Ferrie.
Let me show you his picture. 
Please answer the question.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Did they live?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
No.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
And what would I have to do?
Virginia.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Why were you with him?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Help us do what?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Why does it need to be dark?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
He's the one who wants you.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
How many trips did you make?
Cash poor?
You get a chance to use it?
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
Really?
How old's Annette?
I called you last night.
He tries to act cool.
You're avoiding the question.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Ray wants him.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
He's already there.
What's he doing?
That's Ordell's.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Wanna go?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
I beg your pardon?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Not yet.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
You didn't count it?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
How long you been with Ordell?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
Do you got something for me?
I knew it.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I don't know. One of your friends.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Uh-huh.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Want a hit?
Four days ago.
Two months shy of four years.
Bank robbery.
Yeah.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
You live with him.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
We're leaving now!
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
What's your cost?
Are you serious?
I dunno.
That was Beaumont.
What's your relationship?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Where did you shoot her?
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
What's up with this shit.
Well, give it to me then.
My office.
Call her, tell her the combination.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
No.
Then what are you doing here?
It's all been a dream.
Just to see you. That's all.
What do you mean?
It's cold.
Now what?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
... I've seen them, too.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Sarah.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
I had this weird flash just then.
What?
Louis, you're a life saver.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
It's good to see you.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
But I see them.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Did you look around the headboard?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What's in here?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Jake!
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Why do you bring her up?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
That's your decision.
Who else were you expecting?
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Me neither.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
I don't know you.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
What is it?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I no from around here.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Jacob Singer?
Nothin' much.
I don't know.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Who is?
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
I have some ice from the machine.
Is he all right?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Okay, enough of this shit.
It's locked!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Sergeant!
Hey! I'm not ready.
We'd need charges.
How many?
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Med-kit?
What if you miss?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Now that's just gross.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Later.
What do we do?!!
Ow!
Sorry, sorry.
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
What good will that do?
More soldiers?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
I know who he is...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
That's it! Radio in for help!
He's comin' up -- !
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
What'll I tell the kids?
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
She's right.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What stinks so bad?
What? What?!
He ate a car?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
This has got to be one big violation...
Quint...?
Just keep kicking.
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Well... is everything all right?
What's that supposed to prove?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
What do you see?
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You know how I feel about her.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Excuse me?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
We definitely want it to have junk.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
You do?
Oh, okay. Like this.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
No.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Elbow.
You mean like couples?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Hly shht!
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Are you takin' the pictures?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Happy birthday Adele.
Turkey mostly.
Tight fit.
Can't hurt.
That bad?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
...and?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
...You know what I mean?
What happened?
Yes.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Yeah.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Telly.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
I know what you mean.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Why not? You stink.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
You sure?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
At the block party?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
No, Fidget, I...
No...
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
One.
What?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Thanks.
You are being ripped open.
Passion...
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah I get bored.
It's me. Telly.
What are you guys doing?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Casual.
You are!  I don't like you.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
The message!  I figured out--
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
To get your attention.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You know her?
But you said you didn't know her.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Very good.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
It isn't Kathy.
What about prints?
No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
What do you think he did?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
A building?
Where were you last night?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Did you send the car?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
He knows you're aware of that.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
What are you looking for?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
That's not fair!
Did you call?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<u>What</u>?
That's a better one.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
You have not slept in two days.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
From here, I must go alone.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You're coming with us.
How did you know?
They can be saddled.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
You too are lonely.
How did you know I had sons?
It should be an interesting journey, then.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm not hungry.
Go, join them.
Put me down, you lout!
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
They'll trample him to death!
He will not!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
It is the time.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
She bore you many children?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
It will not help.
Why do you want to know?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
The yellow and pink.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
What?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...Don't you drink?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Do you recognize him?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
It's impossible.
Nothing's going to happen.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Are you a preacher?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
Yes?
It's a special day isn't it?
I do love you... very, very much.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This story is big huh?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
What happened?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
I'm walking there Kris.
Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
What do you want?
...Noooo.
Water?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
Don't run away.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Your color.
Will you lighten up, please?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
That's right.
Are we done for today?
Is he always such an ass?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Thank you.
You're not going up there.
What did you see when you entered the house?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
How'd it go at the trial?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
The idiot speaks.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Too demure?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Neat.
Good luck.
The what?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Is he the only one?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
You're beautiful.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
You go where?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
We come watch... we come watch...
We go out, smash 'em now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
God protect me.
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
Do it now!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
No, wait... please... listen...
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
It's bluebells!
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Will you lead me to her?
Are we here?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Shhhh!
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Worse than the battlefield.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Nice piece of work.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Is she... dead?
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Wait, Jack.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Water doesn't burn...
One more turn...
Did you bring me here to sup?
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Go on... go on...
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
What shall we do?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
How much longer?
Shhh!
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
They rival the angels of paradise.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Pinching?  Where?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Not very precise directions.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
I don't believe you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
And sweet?
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Heading north still?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
What's that for?
Mom said I should.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
My keys.
Did you feel anything?
I don't know.
We're not gonna do anything.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
I don't wanna go.
It could have been a squirt gun.
And if I enclosed it?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
how much weight have you lost?
I've been here twenty years.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Thanks for the shower.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Did you got through my pants?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
What are you now?
I know parts of who you are.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Left you this place.
Thanks for telling me.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?
Lock the door behind you.
Where have you been for a week?!
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I used to live here.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
That was the truth.
I'm married.
Nothing.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Despite you.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?
A night in the hole?
These are free papers.
Not for me, it ain't.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Want me to come back some other time?
That's because I've never been here before.
Don't I know you?
You went to Monroe?
What are they gonna do to us?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Start your job? What kind of job?
No, tell me what's so funny.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
So you made a generous contribution.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
He's dead.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
So?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
I don't know. Who do you want?
You get ketchup?
What am I gonna eat?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Let it go, Claude.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What the hell are you doing?
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
You sure it was him?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
It's too late for plans.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Apparently, your sister died.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
An angel?
How did you see me?
Valerie's crying!
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
No. This can't be happening.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Dude. Seriously?
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
What were you thinking coming here?
What are you doing?
Why would you be floating?
Can we go fly over Central Park?
No.
I don't know.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
He was killed.
No.
Not about that.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
K.
Maybe... sure...
I let him go... believe me.
What're you going to do?
Maybe you'll think of something...
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
How will they know we're coming?
How do we know this is the right way?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Of course.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
We can't. We're going back.
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Is it inside the city?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
How long have you been living here?
I have always been here...
Gracious... no.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Well? How do you like it?
Sure.
Pete?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Are you positive he knows?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Are you my man?
You got him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Sure.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
No.
That's not Fred Madison?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What's the matter?
Who is it?
What's bothering you, Madison?
Called? When?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
We will.
Let's go home.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
It'll be ready.
Okay.
What?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Hey... Sheila.
Sheila... Stop...
All of it?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
I see.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Certainly not.
The police?
What are we going to do?
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
Gold. You were going to—
Nothing. Why?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
How do you do?
Where is your mad pilot?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
You have no disputes over women?
He amputated his own leg?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Suppose she should leave it?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Now, what would you like to do?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Yes.
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you the High Lama?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
What are these people?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George, what do you think you're doing?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
In for what?
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
A man whose life was empty!
Thank you.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
You do?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
She didn't even know you. .
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
You don't know the half of it.
What?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
what's this?
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus...
Kay--
He's here to help!?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
You were saying?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Sure.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
They're not my pals--
Will it lower the curve?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
They're gone.
They went right to the President.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Drop some money.
No.  Follow him.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Please, I want to go back...
Yeah --
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
What?
You're kidding, that's today?
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Yeah?  So?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
So?
Rufus, play it back...
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Sean --
The precogs were wrong.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
What about the picture --
Who made you do this?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
And how did Lamar become involved?
So you won't help me?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
What safe place is that?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
John?
This is all my fault.
I thought you were retiring?
Sean --
Tell him not now.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
No.
You mean after he lost your son.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
I can take you down there.
Thank you, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
He's okay.
He's alright.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Hello.
What time is it there?
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
But what about them?
What's your record at?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Where's Ricky?
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
A million. Easy.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Yeah.
Yeah. Sure.
You don't know where you're going?
We're with Ruiz.
What are you saying?
We don't need guns.
Bullshit...
We look good this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Pretty nice.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
I told you what they said.
How'd they know who you were?
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Don't even start.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where do you think you're going?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
He wants to see us now.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
What about it?
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
You look good, man.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Why? What I say bad?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
I'm half Irish.
Does anyone want another?
No, really, mate?
Yeah.
Nah, man...
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yes. You're going to New York.
What about my keys?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
I'll get it.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Man's rep travels.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
I'm working on it.
You never had it.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
That's what Mama used to say.
Where am I gonna start?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I sure met some.
I can't.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
What do you think?
Talk about what?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Shhh!
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
I say a lot of things.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Me?
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I ain't doing bad.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
I show, you give me the information?
Deal.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
Who's he?
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
How does it affect you?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
You did something on impulse?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Who's Emilio?
We're taking a different way home.
Not at all?
Do you always sleep with him?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Did you used to?
Could I ask you a question?
Then be trained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
What was her name?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
It will be a hard break.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
Hey, Herbie...
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
It's her baby too, you know.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Please...
We just live one flight up.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
What?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
That's the one.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
That's right.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
We got to stop them right here.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
The chest-cutter.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Never heard of him.
We're a good team.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Radar!
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
The bastards outconned us.
Our minds?
Very happily married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
No, never in the slightest.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
O'Reilly!
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
What's that, Henry?
Never mind.
Did you get it, too?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against anything. Just protest.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Ted Sheldon.
Yes, sir.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
What John Doe?
A deal?
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
He's watching the other door.
Had any schooling?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
What do they want?
Who's got him?
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
I trust him.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Yeah. It certainly is.
I want it as soon as possible.
Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Yeah.
What?
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Apartment 306.
You want me to go up with you?
Really?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Explain how that works.
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
What the fuck is going on.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
McCall, you all right?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
I ain't interested in your life story.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
If you did, you never showed it.
Scottie...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Stay up there, Girl...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Tell him to give me a raise.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
I want to be put on this case.
What do we got?
This is Halden.
They have nothing to do with this --
This is how you pick up women --
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
No.
In a computer program.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
New York.
What's her name?
He had keys.
Two maze runners.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
I know.
What's so funny?
Just like that?
Program name?
He's on us!!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Just shut your gap!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
But ya got a Boss.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Up here, Boss.
Whatever you say, Boss.
He was around...
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Who hired the bastard?
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
Who'll make the rules?
No. We ain't even...
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
What's your problem?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Come off it, Bugs.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
You boys carryin' pieces?
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
I've got friends.
I don't fuck my partners.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Okay. I'm listening.
Strategy.
Where's the stiff?
Kill them! Kill them!
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
At the moment, yes.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Bitchin' good cake.
Got a doctor on duty.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
How was it? I don't recall.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Hypnos?
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Stu...Stu...
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Uh-huh?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
Behind the books.
Mother, I ...
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Who is it?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
And where is she?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I see.  How much?
Forty-five all total.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Never.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
My friends?
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
Is the wind tired out there?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Otis!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
The--head?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Mr. President!
For a question!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will he yield for a question?
For a *question*.
It does!
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
No, Jeff--please--!
Yes, Ma?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
*No*!
Is--is something the matter?
No. What had you better--?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Why?
Yes, I see that.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
On paper?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
No complaints.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
No!
Letitia.
No!
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Not another bill?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
What are you going to do?
Wait--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Hurray!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
How are the pigeons?
That's--that's splendid.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
I know that.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
You can't say *that* to--
Maybe he won't get up.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Good morning.
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Most every day.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Oh, yes.
No. Are you?
Yes.
Yes!
And you saw them happen?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Ready?
People have been crucified before.
The guy's balmy.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
You're acting like a school girl.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Uh-huh.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
You can't come up here!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
But your honor—
I can't find him.
Yes?
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Why, no.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
We provide opera.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Brookfield just came in.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yeah. What?
Every man to his taste, sir.
What's that?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Who?
Me, sir?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
You must have been concerned.
Uh-huh.
What an asshole!
You find it distasteful, don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
You like me. How come?
Okay.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
But you know how to drive?
You're good.
What's happening here?
Ph.D., psychologist.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
I think you know what I mean.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
What would you do?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Be specific.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
...How violated I feel?
Oh.
Anything... just ask.
We're only talking about six weeks.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
It's called pro bono.
No again?
How are you?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Is that the question?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
A doll?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Really?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Did you carry a gun?
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Immune from what?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
No women allowed.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
I just decked your brother
Yes.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No... Why?... Should I?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Got guts, lady.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Finish the inscription, idiot!
She's my sister, actually.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
And what's that?
Your mind is so slippery.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
You're dead.
Come here.
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Hi.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What?
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Are you coming or not?
So why don't you just tell her!
The who?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
The Obliterators!
Are you famous?
Here you go. 
Oh hi, Mom.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
And, what a delightful idea!
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
What do you mean?
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
But who made this treaty?
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Bertrand, sire.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been there for three years.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Does your mother know you have come?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
No...
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
I will never forgive you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes!!
Who is it?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I believe you sent for me.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
What the hell is the matter with you?
How do you know?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
And where do you place Alexander?
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
It's cool, but where's the water?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Yes you did.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Nobody!
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Man, this a cool house.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Why?
You walked?
You know what this is?
How can they do this?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
It works.
Wait.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Hello, remember me?
What are you doing here?
You did all this for me?
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
Here I come!
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Today ain't my day.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I'll take you later.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Need to lose some weight.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I...
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
That's...a comfort to hear.
Ah.
Who did?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I'm just an accountant.
It's a twenty.
Oh, man...
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
What?
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
That one.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
What gives?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
I'll bet.
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You go set down by the River.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
It's all here.
Are we goin' home, John?
Up river.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What's taking you so long about it?
All right boy: where's the money?
O no! Your turn!
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
I -- no, I --
She took them kids with her?
I been bad!
This man down at the Drugstore...
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
What the hell's going on!?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
You believe in anything?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
She dreamed this would happen...
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
You don't know he did it.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Krueger.
Get into bed.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Screw sleep!
Give me the key, mother.
Someone else was there.
Well, here are fifty francs.
What is it, Ninotchka?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
He's cutting our throat...
We had to take it on account of the safe.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Gaston.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
I am, Gaston.
Have you?
No, sir.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can call our ambassador.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
We don't want to be disturbed.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
What did she say about me?
A cow?
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
We did our best, Comrade.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Yes!
Oh no. No visa.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Don't do it, please.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Do you hear that?
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
Room service speaking.
I don't like your following me.
It's nine o'clock.
Ninotchka, I love you.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
It's dead.
...but big.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Make it ice cold.
Yes.
Hello, Leon darling!
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Where are they?
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Yes.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Thank you.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Where's Hunt now?
And?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
That's right ...
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, why not?
"Security" is not strong enough.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
How is this national security?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
We really must go, Mr. President.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
I can't ...
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
And me? ...
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Yes, Mr. President.
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Uh, wait ...
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Hi.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Yes, yes.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
You.  What' you're doing --
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Won or lost?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
How you been, Ellis?
Yes, you've circled round.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Uh-huh.
Oh yes.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
So when was he here?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Don't get hurt.
It ain't even three years we been married.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
You know she won't be there.
No. Do you?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
With what?
Now. We close now.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Just call it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yes?
Could I get another room.
Another additional.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not any way.
Cast iron?
Were you in Nam?
So was I.
No I don't have it.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Jesus...
What about it?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Do you know why I'm here?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
...what're you saying?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, you mean Fred.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Why are you doing this to me?
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
I have... did it sound that bad?
George...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
So, call me when you --
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...
I don't know.
Make sure it's elevated...
Yes.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
What's the matter here?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
You made out alright.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Doctor David Ravell.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Why'd you help me in the first place?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Of what?
Relax, we brought the cash.
You told me how to do it!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
It's not here. Let's go.
We can live with that.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
Where? Where is she?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Oh, five years, give or take.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
What'd you get her?
Isn't that the point?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Is there a problem, George?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
You lie, motherfucker...
Yeah?
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
...Pete?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
What's his name again?
Them straw polls is ugly.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
You -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Don't I know it.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
The preacher said it absolved us.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
It was a powerful air.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Yes, sir!!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Everything was different.
How did it go with you guys?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
I'd like to come with you.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Jets.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
No problem.
There is not one thing funny here.
That's right.
Yes.
Remember that.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
You got an idea?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
They won't get hurt.
Asshole.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
I mean it!
Everything okay?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Master bath.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
That room!
"What we want is in that room."
Call Dad!
Uh uh.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Naw... I gotta...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You mean...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I don't know about that.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
What?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
No.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
You don't know him very well, do you?
You got salt last week.
That one is a bit more difficult.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Prisoner exchange.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
And the Governor?
Father...
Oh?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
And what do they know?
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
One of yours?
Gabriel.
I am, I think.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Please hurry.
No-I guess not.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Not at all.
I can hardly read these.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
I don't know.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I'm not climbing that.
Why? For God's sake, why?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Don't worry about that.
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Let her go. It's cool.
The movers--
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
My God!
She's finally asleep.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
That's forgotten.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
I'll torture it out of you.
Wait as long as you like.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Why don't I want to do this?
Do you believe him?
I'll drop it!
You've got sand, for a maid.
Boy overboard!
Did he speak?
Commodore, you can't do that!
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
What?
Why would my father send this to me?
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Miss Swann.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Raise the sails.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
You cheated.
Move away.
I can get you out of here.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Is that so?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Are you certain this is the right way?
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
A moment.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
Like rotting meat.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She says it's not.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Why are there two ottomans?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Aaabout...?
Well, you got another problem.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You were never invited to my house.
I don't believe this is happening...
What's it smell like?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Same old Daniel.
Is that so?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You're insane.
They did it to me!
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Who is he?
Yes.
You're not going after Argon!
Things do change.
That's impossible.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Where did you get those letters?
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
What is this person doing here?
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
You're my what?
Dawson, sir.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
My error.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Okay.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Hello, Smith.
Have you seen this? 
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
You try it.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
What?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I won't.
Oh, hello Betty.
I've got to go ...
What is that?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Thank you very much.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
What happened?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
You're not allowed to lie.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Oh my God.
We're supposed to be in school.
You know him?
Who's that?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER!
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
What did you do to him?
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Well if I don't who will?
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
What?
Right here.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Real rain?
Can I open it?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
How much does it cost?
What the hell's going on!
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh--well ...
Look ...
I'm going to leave now.
How long do you think you've been here?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
It's an art book.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Free?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
No, no, no.
What city?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Yes.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
So you think you can?
No. I'm sorry.
This is not cool.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
No, no. I did.
You see?
....yeah....
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
This is Barry.
That was good.
Have a good trip.
Lena?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just wanted to make sure.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Well who did?
Your hand is bleeding.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
What do you mean?
And your Social Security number.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
It's alright.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
It takes time to process --
WHICH?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Are you serious with this?
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
That's cool.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
Marquis? Is that you?
Yes, Abbe?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
What on earth would that require?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Of course.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
Of course.
He'll do no such thing.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll be waiting.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Don't start --
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Of course.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
I wonder sometimes.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Sure
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
The actor
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
So I've been told.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
I will not defend my life to you--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Huh?
We're using-
He personally asked you to?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Oh for Christ's sake-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Fuck you--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Craig is one syllable
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Hey, kid. Gregg.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Herman.
To do what?
You're going to destroy it
Yes
Get out
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
Please don't ask me to do this.
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Oh, no--
He's Christ?
How can he embarrass you?
What's up, Colonel?
Believe what you want.
Where you going at this hour?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You know?
You want me to do what?
Answer me when I talk to you.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What do you mean?
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
What?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Now, touch me...  ...here.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
I'm not interested in him.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You did?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Jake --
Then what?
I dunno.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Sure, what else is new?
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
He should.
How's the weight? Ok?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Like disposing of their wives?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
A detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
For what?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Why should I?
No.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I knew it!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
And some man will lose his.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
What about this morning? Any developments?
I wonder.
What do you need money for?
How much do you think you'll need?
Ten here.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
What a day I've had!
Yes.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I have one now.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Nothing, thank heaven.
There's nothing to see.
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
I wonder where he's going now?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Sure.  It's fine.
Yeah.
I like you, you know?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Any other entrance?
I think I should go home.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
He depended on me.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Where did you get the gun?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
You remember me?
What?
Are you really going to meet them?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Why?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Chicken?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Now that's true!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
A what?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Why?
You disappointed?
You smell like baby powder.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
I was talking to Dad.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Do that again.
One more. Smile. One more.
You need a COAT!
Well, I don't know about that --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
I thought we'd have a few more days.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
They all are. Football's on.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
Wish I had a brother like you.
What'd they call her in high school?
What the fuck are you talking about.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
What's the code?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No way.
Take 'em.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Fuckin' freezing.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
What about the money?
Monsters in the gelatin...
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Rudy, don't move --
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Do what?
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Yes.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
I can do that.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
You gonna put it away?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Sorry, it's my book now.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
What's this guy's problem?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Lie back down, and try to -
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
As opposed to good?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
No real people?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
And one of 'em is sick.
As far as -- Sonora?
So am I.
Where do you keep the can opener?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I'll make the soap myself.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
I found their surrey --
Which ranch?
Who's Lednov?
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
I've got eleven horses.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Yeah, it does.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
I don't care what she asked you.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Go away -- please.
There aren't any women here.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
How do you know who we are?
Where is he?
We got company. Female company.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Aren't we stayin'?
That's the end of the line.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
But you're his brother.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
That's it.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
So, whatever happened to her?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Stop touching his brain!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
This can't be happening?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Huh?
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Did you do that?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Got a problem with that?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
And sexy.
That's right.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
What?
It says, "Ray."
"Ray!"
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Oh Mom...
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
In here, Mom...
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Detectives, what is this about?
Hi, Hank.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
We can be real quiet...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Don't wake the kids...
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
So you do drink?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
What was that?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
How much does she want?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
What did she want to know?
Why?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But it's a small room, Jason.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Jason, my pet ——
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Dr. Judd?
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I'll be out in a minute.
I don't believe it.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Do you have other things?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
What's the first?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
I have money.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Yes.
About me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
On tape?
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Why not?
Who? Elizabeth?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Why?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
What upsets you about that?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Radon leakage?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Not really.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No!
What!?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
What is it?
Thank you.
There's a phone here.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
When I was fourteen.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
He said that my hand felt good.
Then what happened?
Yes.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I want to see you.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Hung up.
Graham.
So is my wife, asshole!!
Give me your keys.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
One moment.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Where is he now? Do you know?
We live in 703.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Gonna cut me open?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
Shove it, Ralph!
I'm not going, Janet.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
It's...
I'm...happy.
Fabulous!
F for...
WHAT A JOKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The fuck was that?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Why are you being so defensive?
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
You got it.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
What happened to you guys?
I can explain.
I am one of those guys.
I can't help the traffic.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
I'd rather have a knife.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Are you chewing gum?
And she likes Pinot.
So what's the plan today?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
What do you think?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Bathroom.
We were supposed to play golf.
I will.  See ya!
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Nice shot.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What's that supposed to mean?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Me?
Look at this!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
You got kids?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
That was fun last night.
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
I'm scared.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Curse and stuff.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
They're on the roof.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
It's getting stronger.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Yes.
What's two?
Where are we going to sleep?
Did someone save me?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
Don't do it!
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
No money, eh?
...And you had to kill him?
I didn't know you were out.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
I already did that.
You're not Baxter?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
I had to get up anyway.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
South of here, past Chimayo.
No hard feelings.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
Who is he?
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
What makes you think I could?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I've given that up.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
What's she got to do with it?
That's the good stuff.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
That was my plan.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Spare me.
I can't wait to meet her.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Even the fall from the plane?
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Really?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
My two favorite girls.
Not quite.
I just read somewhere --
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Not if I don't let her.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
No, I'm okay.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
Is she here?
You want me to call Security?
I was misquoted.
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She still with Kent?
Me too.
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
No, that was me.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Dark?
Long live the First Amendment.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Wow. They called you their son.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Don't step in the horse manure.
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Why?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
I didn't know you were funny.
Dr. Crowe.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
When?
Yes.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
You really look better.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
They're right here.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Communicate?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Yes, Cole?
It's our pleasure.
Meaning?
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
I happen to be a professional.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Suzie... No.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Like what?
Second verse!
Someone better tell Mac.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
No reception out here.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Meat.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Who's that?
I loved you. I loved --
When one sees you they all see you.
Where'd he go?
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Last year, this was a new rig.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Kate McConnell.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
But you could get killed, right?
A what?
Well?...
Anything?
Jesus!!!
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Yeah?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
What are you thinking?
But you'll do it?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Liquid gold.
We still on schedule?
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Mortal.
Yeah.
Ww... uh...
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
But there were more of you?
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
I'm here, where's the car?
Without peer?
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
...Does he know?
...Are you insane?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
-- never in a million girl --
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
I DON'T KNOW!
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
A puppet.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
What?
Who was it?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I'll go with you.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Then it's God, right?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
I love you.
No.
Chris --
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Right.  That's true.
Beg pardon?
Let's get a drink.
Could be, I guess.
What's to like?
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
Stop, will you?!
What do you want to do?
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
When can I see you?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Not if you don't want me to.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
What shit, honey?
I think -- she's crazy.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Why?
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I just sat and listened.
What about when she goes out?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Who's Joey Venza?
... Hard?
No, I will not step outside.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Lay back, Mack.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
See?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Can't focus...
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
You should write that one down.
Some prep school thing.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Well, no.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Waldos.
You sure about all this?
Of course.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
It's Friday night...
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Poison emergency.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Your dog ate it.
What?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Who is it?
How much more do we have to take from him?
How did he get over there?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What is your number?
105-353.
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
No, Animal.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Yes, sir.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Lay off, Sefton.
You starting that again?
You did!
What are we going to do with him?
What's the decoy?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
What did you say?
I'll kill you for that!
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
It's working.
Where is he now?
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I get it. I get it.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Left behind?
These are my children...my children.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Understood. That will be all.
Report.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The royal...studs?
Trilithium?
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Why don't we beam it up?
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Sir...?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Close... There --
Yours...?!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
What you ask is difficult.
How can you tell that?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Say thank you.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
They even killed the galley chief.
Is that a poem?
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Maybe...
Does that about do it?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I'm trying, David.
Is that what you came here to say?
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
On screen.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
The power of creation --
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Yes.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Shields activated!
Prepare for warp speed.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
... I don't think he understands...
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But you said toxic.
Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
I have no control, sir!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
They are my friends.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
You're what?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Data doesn't breathe.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
I do not take orders from you.
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
You've not aged a day since then?
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why was Data assigned?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Are you saying they won't help us?
Not yet.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
How long has he been unconscious?
I do not know what you are referring to.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Who are you?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
What did you do to the batteries?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Their com system must still be down.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Main bus...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Yes.
California. San Francisco.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Life signs?
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
I didn't mean this future.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
Yes.
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
What took you so long?
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Captain...
The peace conference.
I SHOULD have been -
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
A lie?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
NO WAY!
That could take hours!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
- could take weeks, sir.
Can you remember our father?
No. I must deactivate you.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That was another time.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
What purpose does this serve?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Counselor?
This isn't real.
You're not here.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
How long until he can fire?
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
And you're not as we imagined you.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I know.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I don't know.
It’s too late.
Report!
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Find her again.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
You don't have to understand.
Praetor.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Right in line with that burning tree.
I'll take that.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I don't like it, George...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
What's all this for?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I just retired.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
What?
What?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
What?
Gas.
Who?
I am husband?
You want to try it?
What's the matter?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I will see it next time.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
But I must go here.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not want to.
You can have one.
Where are you going?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Asshole!!
You promised.
They are beautiful.
But...
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
How long will it take you to get home?
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
You married, Major?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
You know that's impossible!
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Forget it's there.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
We should talk alone.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
That's not sayin' much.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Is he dead?
Okay... what about Strickland?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Commissioner Strickland.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Coming with you.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Shit!
You sure?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Got your ticket?
Just Lenny.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
I've been looking for you.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
I think I talked to him.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
How do you feel, Agent
"Was?"
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I understand.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Yes I do.
The man knew how to dress.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
The tattoo?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
And you're working with him?
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Jaime --
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Agent...
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Thomas Mackelway.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
How far is Amarillo?
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You should call your Grandmother.
What's that like?
What else?
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
The poor thing. Six years?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, who represents you back east?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Yeah. And an actor.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
I can call back...
Yeah.
I thought you met someone else.
I miss you, Mike.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
It's a gig.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I didn't mention her once today.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Thanks, man.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
She was cute.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
VEGAS.
You're crazy.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
What an asshole.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Yeah, a good friend.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
What?!?
What?
Was I money?
Oh, it's on, baby...
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
That was pretty cold, dude.
...we're not...
It's on...
It is on.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You take care of your family?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
What about McCluskey?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Please say it.
I'm busy.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
We're going to New Jersey?
What is it?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Buy me out?...
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You just woke up!
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, darling.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Can you mix a martini?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
This is so good of you.
Could we sail to Venice?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
That's good.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Oh God, I don't think so.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I just don't believe that!
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Frances?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Is this you?
Randall.
What?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Dickie Greenleaf?
Yes?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Does he stay with you here?
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
Huh?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
What?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
I'm leaving.
This is sort of high class...
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
What about the record?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Is he Italian?
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Where.
You looking for some action?
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
Do they drug you?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Where?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Got your license?
Also clean.
Age?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Who?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
So howsit?
Wiz?
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Not really.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
God's speed.
I believe you.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I see you got the telegram.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
What.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
And why not?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
I... I need a drink of water.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Mother o'god...
No.  But...
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
You bet.
Yes?
The film broke...
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Sandra Sinclair.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
I guess I did.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
She's very pretty.
Huh?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
What?
Is there a young Tim?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
Yes?
I think so.
And what had you done?
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
And the second?
Yes, I did.
They haven't harmed anyone.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Oh, I suppose so.
Darling, of course I do!
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Good morning.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
The two kids?
Daniels.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Tell him about the party.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
They're gone. The same pattern.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If they are?
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
What?
No.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I don't mind, really.
Not by the thousands.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
How can you tell?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Yes?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
You are, aren't you?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
What do you want ?
Like what?
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It's an uprising.
It's so damn quiet out there.
No, no...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
I don't know why.
How do you plan to do that?
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
I haven't finished my drink.
I want you to help my little girl.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
I've heard of it.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
But this woman -- and her son --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But you did promise.
Well --
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
You've no thought of going there?
This is not a woman!
I thought this was a school day.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
It might be an interesting case.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
The heart pumps it.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I come from Lisbon.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Fucking crow.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
What's with your friend there?
What were you yelling about?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Please. Come inside.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Yes.
Yes -- of course.
That can easily be arranged.
Professor Barnhardt.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Did all these people die in wars?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Thank you... Have you any news?
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Everyone seems so-- 
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
I want to know what he told you last night.
What happened?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I -- I thought you were--
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
They would have killed this man?
How do you like Santa Carla?
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
The meanest!
With him?
I will, David!
Ouch, my hair...
I told Max eight o'clock.
Good!
No.  I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Ocean air!
You've heard this story before?
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Not funny, Sam!
Mom!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
I am?
What do you mean?
Me, too.
Let's go see them.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I was here first.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What about Mom?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Sixteen.
What do you want from us?
Finish what?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Childs!!
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
What clothes?
Not the only one.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
My God, what in hell happened here?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hey, man...!
No.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
What's...
He might just wait us out.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
And everyone looks like us?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Where?
The Hall of Books.
Yes...
The air... the power.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
And why not?
Well there's something new.
Admiration?  My my.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
Alex...?!
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Heavens, look at that now!
Tonight's the night?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I can't do that --
That's absurd --
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Yes.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes.
And this is your "work"?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
What are you?
You know this?
You lost someone.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
May I get you some --
Might I ask why?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Then it's time to change that --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
How?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
[Beat] What's your name?
You're just gonna walk?
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Exactly.
You don't understand.
It doesn't look all that different.
What about the world?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
You want a drink?
How?
What?!
Who's the nut?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You girls are in some hot water.
A .38.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
What's wrong?
Stop.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
What did ya do?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
How?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Hello...
Yes.
In the back?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Exactly.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Did you finish thinking?
Call him?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Ready?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Louise?
Yes, Thelma?
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
I'll try to be more careful.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
I'm asking you to leave.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
What?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
So... I see you made the news.
Who?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
By the way, what's your name?
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
No.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Nope. Never been.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
And you met Mary how?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Four.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
What's he like?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
You don't think they're too big?
No, it's an old football injury.
So who you taking to the prom?
Huh?
Are you all right?
Really? I never got a message.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
So you're a writer?
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Franks and beans!
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Yes it is.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
No you weren't.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
I don't care. Cancel it.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
Hello?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
I see.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
I don't see the connection.
Cuz I'm a skin?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Who did?
Ray...
Mister Tully.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I saw one.
Two.
I'm special.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Make what?
No!
Does it bother you?
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Just good luck.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
That's what I want.
One more.
Looks like a tie.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Can't shake him.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
Saving them some paperwork.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Is it you?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Like what?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
That's Kazanski.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
ON THE NOSE?
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Who is the best.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Bad?
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
All right.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
My wife's house.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What to the rebels want?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Fuck you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
You open it.
Where?
Yeah.
Let me buy you a drink.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Well...What do you say?
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Doug...Bob McClane.
That a problem?
How real does it seem?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
I said get out!
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
How much you think?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Somebody paying you to do this?
Yeah, Val.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
True.
Objection.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
I'm not that desperate.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
My mother find you?
Racist asshole came at me.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
This and that.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
HE'S GONE.
What?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Oh, the uncle is missing.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
James called me last night looking for you.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
What were you doing in my room?
Did you get this from your lover?
Mr. Abraham...
I'm fine.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
You thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
No.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Yes.
...and you're going to do that?
The most respected...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Thank you.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Why is that?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
What happened...?
Who told you that?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What are you going to do?
Continental Casualty...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
What do you want?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
...Gruber's not bad.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
I'm swell.
That's right.
Yeah. I'm awake.
What did she do?
...yeah... good...
She did?
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, the roving nurse...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Hey, how about that!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Where are we?
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
They don't do much of anything...!
D.O. to number three..come in.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
You mean that was a...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
He was just here!
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Time for sleep.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Your bed?
Right 'cross the freeway.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
What are you talking about?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Yes?
I didn't know sir.
Come in.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Where you going?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
No, I didn't.
Passport?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
How do you know?  They might.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Sir...?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
What's that?
Immortality.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
It hurts too much to care.
Suicidal...
Joy, rapture...
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Yessir.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
What's Cao Ben?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Sorry to hear it.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
When did you talk to Lula?
Have now.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
What is it, Johnnie?
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
And?
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Sailor!
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
What's that, peanut?
Huh?
You got me, peanut.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
You knew my daddy?
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Love you, too.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
You must be my son.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
I'll bet.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Got any plans?
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Yes.
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back.
You got nice tits.
Someone's gonna see us.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
So what's the problem?
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
A little.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Want me to get that?
What'd he say?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Afraid so.
But... ?
So where have you been staying?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Colon cancer.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
I just wanted a little sip.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Get out of here.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
All right. This morning --
She's left before...
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's that sitting in your car?
And what do you think you might have said?
Did you tell Walter?
He's writing his name in water.
Grady?
This is important.
I was thinking of you.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
That's weird.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
No, the dog.
Are you riding with me, James?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
It was a beautiful present.
What's happening?
The birthday party.
No thanks.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
I don't like starlings.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I'd love to hear it.
I'm not pretty.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I would.
They grow outside, don't they?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
Yes.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
People have the right to know.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Does he?
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
Can't I stay a little longer?
What?
A diary?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
It was just an idea.
No fucking way.
It's okay.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
You have no feelings for your niece?
I'm afraid not.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I don't know.
You're very late.
Close your eyes.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I'm talking about you.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
K through sixth.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
No you're not.
Do you?
You're not joking.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Their power. They seduce me.
You know, this is crazy.
Are you serious?
What?
I'm not scared.
We should live together.
Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
You got it?!  You got it?
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Wasn't up to me.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Need some help?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Virgil?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
You better not say you missed that.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
He can still make it.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But how could you say such a thing?
Well?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
And what about you?
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
Good night, my love.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
You men are all so dreadful!
Don't you ever paint men?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
They didn't seem too good.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Who told you this?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I'm not hungry.
Why?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
What do you mean?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes...
No.
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Like what?
Who?
Do you believe she really saw them?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Is that what she said?
Everything... I don't have children.
What did you do?
No...
She's dead isn't she?
She watches... she listens.
Yes?
Her headaches.
Alright.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you pretty?
Yes I am.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
May I open my eyes now?
It grew.
I can't tell you that.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
My bed.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Why?
How did she know about him?
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Who?
She took the baby in her arms?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks. 
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
The one up on the third floor?
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
No-one.
Yes.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
I haven't a clue.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
This was before her pregnancy?
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
???  
There's another choice.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
The sheets...
About what?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Her spiritual health.
Because I am a moral person.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Would it stop you if I did?
For the Church?
The father!
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
I'm concerned about her health.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
That's a lie.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Oh, don't do this!
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Just you?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Ever seen one of these before?
We're nearly there, sir.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Ta.
I don't care.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
A butcher?
Well ... come on.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Well, what happened?
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Gear?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Parading's better!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
What little old man?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Gie's a kiss!
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Like what?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Let's have you.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Oh, leave off!!!
That's mine.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh, what's all this?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Engines off.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Can we come up?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Hello, Faust!
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Where does that go?
What the hell's going on?
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Still unconscious?
Can you do anything for him?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
We've got six hours left.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
No.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
We can use the flamethrower.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
That way.
It's close, real close.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I thought I'd find you here.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Find anything we missed?
Oh well... you know me.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Food-storage room!
Now what?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Better?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Where is she?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
You win some, you loose some.
Where're they headed?
What's going on?
Oh, man...
Hey, Guttierez?
What?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
And before that?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
I call myself Phoebe.
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
What time?
Almost four.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
What have you got to do with it?
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Let's go sit by the piano.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Being violently ill to her tummy.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Bill!
Where?
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
I mix what I like.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Paranoiac!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Hello, what's your name?
I just wondered.
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Don't run away, Bill.
You think?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Buy some.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
You all put together?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
Late for what?
What for?
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Oh, no...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
I'll never get over it.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Why should he - and why should you?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Margo, again...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Now just a minute-
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
She's your understudy.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I have no intention of having an accident!
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Well...
Are you breaking the contract?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
All right, what do we know?
--what do you think?--
That was fun.  What now?
--I'm trying--
We understand your problem--
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
You want me to be the bastard.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
I didn't do anything wrong.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
I don't know what they'd do to me.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
Which people?
But they both worked at the White House?
I will not talk about the other two.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Haldeman too?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Howard Hunt here.
James McCord.
No.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
A boy or a girl?
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
Great evening, isn't it?
Good morning gentleman.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
All right, I got some scotch.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Why is this?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
I'm glad you think so.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
That's not why we're going out.
...I've never tried it.
What?
No you haven't.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
No comment.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
You can send me the address too.
Hey, minuteman.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
What's up, fellas?
Nadia, I can't --
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Hey...
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
See -- this is the nicest room.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Victoria...I love you.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
The key is don't look down.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
What about your glasses?
Don't you want to change?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
God. I can't believe it.
Claude...?
We know you were with her.
Andy...
Claude.
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Is everyone all right?
No! I look ridiculous!
You'll laugh.
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Nervous?
No! Well, yes, but
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
You'd lose your security deposit?
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Hurry up with those papers.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
What do you want?!
I'll show you!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
And tell me that she's happy.
I had nothing to do with it!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Perhaps you could convince her?
Hey, you on television?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Tsch.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh, right.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Don't be funny.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Well...
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Sylvia Plath.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Well, who's Sadie?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Hey?
M'hm.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Look, look at that guy.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Let's just do it, all right?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
It's his name.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Sinatra?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Will it change your wife?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, I had the radio on.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Happy birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You look very pretty.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
Alvy.
Why are you so hostile?
Oswald and ghosts.
I can think of another word.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Yeah.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Probably on their first date, right?
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Forget it, Max.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Oh, Jesus.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh yes.
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
Leo?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You don't have any clothes on.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Honey?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Why would she care?
Fuck you.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
I call that a perfect day.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I don't think so.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Kiss the back of my knees.
Through the sweats or not?
You want me to uninvite her?
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I'm going to throw up.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Otis!!!!
Otis!
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I know.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
The infamous dog?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I meant Sally.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
What am I, five?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Jesus Christ.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I'm so sorry.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Like your business managers?
Like the last time.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
Well, something's wrong.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
And here they are!
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
You dance...
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Want a list?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
So what makes you so special?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
You mean tonight?
What time does the show go on?
Eight-thirty.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
No -- I don't want anything.
And where are you now?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
For me?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Thank you.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I guess so.
I'm fine all over.
What for?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
Don't mind what?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
You threatening me?
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Want to tell me what happened?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
It's regulations.
Well, I have things to do --
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Family?
No.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Come on, Fran.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Important?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I have that date -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Coming?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
Atlantic City?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
One for all -- all for one --
We've been attacked.
Part.
Delta ?
North ?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Sometimes.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
What are we doing here?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
You didn't like him.
Touchy.
Yeah.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Thank you, sir.
Good swell.
You smell that.  You smell that?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
How did we get here?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Fuck no.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You knew him best.
What's that?
When?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
The other one --
What is this bridge?
This boat's a mess.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Where's your chief supply officer?
23   CONTINUED:
117  CONTINUED:  
Let's go.
119  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
She's dead.
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
What happened here?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What are you doing?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Thanks.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
I'm here to do my job.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Neff, you know better than this...
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Get the fuck out of here.
Go easy.
Thought that door was open last night...
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
I'm starving.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
How old are you?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Nice of you... thank you.
I can't. I work.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Hi.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
No!!!
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
No. No. Get Carol.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Actually, I don't think so.
How you doing, great one?
Is he dead yet?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
What?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Oh, my gosh.
Not it at all, really.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
But you know where you're lucky?
How do you write women so well?
Is there a problem?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What?
What restaurant?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
You would be.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
A player?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
I work for the government.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You want me to pump?
You're one of them, aren't you?
An assassin?
So this is something between you and him?
Yes.
I don't need the money.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
What do you want to know?
It looks like white's game.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
I was just different.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The exotic women.
No.  Just the first one.
Several.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
You should knock.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Then, we wait.
We split the money?
Do you have ulcers?
I didn't notice them.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
Why?  I don't know.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Who was she?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I waited another four minutes.
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
How much farther?
It's a common question.
Can I ask you something?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Squatted it.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
He was an electrician?
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No....The Asylum!
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Need any disks?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
No, the boyfriend.
It just happened.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
What?
Tell me some bad news?
Huh?
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
It's...42 56 76 .
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
What are you talking about?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
I could pencil you in if you like?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
Forget about me Kat.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Ah, so what?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
No, just a coffee.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
It's Josh's.
A kind of freedom.
I'm not sure it's possible.
A drill, what are you up to?
Sure!
No problem, is it at your place?
You bastard!
You are quite sure it's secure?
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
And what of these foreigners?
She asleep?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
A late night or an early morning?
Get yourself a glass.
I don't make small talk --
Were?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
This play -- ?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Like you'd know.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Oh. Just not at school...
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
It's not.
Like fire.
I have to get you home by one.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
I don't understand...
Come on.
How do you know this place?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
One of your secrets.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Pull over.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Nope.
I'll talk to your father.
Can I -- go out?
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Dad --
Praying.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Where did you get -- ?
What do you want, Biff?
Morning Dick.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Fine..
Oh yeah.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
And where am I gonna be?
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Marty, that would alter history.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
What year is this?
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Dick? Dick who?
I used to throw trash for the City.
Oh yeah?
What're you doing?
What for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Can I be honest?
Hi.
Great.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
What a nice place.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I don't blame him.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Have you got a better idea?
Really?
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Maybe.
It's mine all right.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Anybody we know?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away.  Let me rot?
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Please, Barton.
I see.
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
If you could, I'd –
What are they like? What are they about?
Well... THIS.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
I want to know!
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
...Who is this?
I write.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
And what would that be, son?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
...Huh? No, I'm –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
He's a great writer –
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
What do you mean?
Why don't we go to your room-
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Anyway.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Yes, Colonel.
Yeah, I was drinking.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
How are you, Nick?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
No, Nick, please --
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
I had him in two classes.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
Are you arresting me?
I told you -- I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Why not?
What's it about?
Why does he do it?
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
How's your shoulder?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Yes I am.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What was the weapon?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
What are you doing here, Pop?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
I went over last night, too.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You feeling better?
If she's telling  you the truth.
I'm going with you.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Now what?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Fuck you, Phil.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Aren't they?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
When?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I need a dealer.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Decipher?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Blue? Where?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
I ain't John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
What who's saying?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
You mean babies with you?
Don't you think he's using you?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
Me? Why?
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
What're you really after?
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
What happened?
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Ten, nine...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
I don't.  So, no.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
I love you, old man.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Can he save her?
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Where is my wife?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Why, indeed?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Letters in the alphabet.
Just checking, young sir.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't want to remember!
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
Okay. I'm outta here.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Thank you, Vicki.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Do you sail?
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
What are you, scared of heights?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
My brother's a priest, man.
I've considered that possibility.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Joker here. Can we talk?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Allie, he's not.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
It isn't working any more, David.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Sort of half.....
Everything's gonna be fine.
shhh...
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
No!
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Welsh again.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
What's gone?
This sucks.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
And Boot-Head.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Me first.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
She's ready.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Of course I did.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We're...
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
And live in what, our station wagon?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Yeah.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
That's it!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
He's your cousin.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Hellooo!  How's school?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
... And please call me Robert.
... Were you going somewhere?
... Oh? You've heard?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I have no idea...
Do you know Raphael?
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
Ben is very ill.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Oh, good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Certainly, Ben.
Oh, I see.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Does it have a television?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
I live here.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
No, I do not have any of those.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Try again.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
No! He's a real gardener!
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
I was worried.
The ferret?
Right.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
What?
What's that?
We?
Suck my dick!
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
My name is Schwartz.
Yes?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
No, really.
Who told you?
You're a fag or a liar.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
You're late.
Lotte, this is so good...
No.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
But I think I have another plan.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Yes, my dear?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Count me in.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
When?
I love you, Lotte.
How do we do that?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte called me.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
You've got to be kidding.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
There ain't.
I likes yellow.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
No. Sorry.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
Baby, don't be like that.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
You on your way home?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
Oh.
Yes ma'am..
Ya think?
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
All he can. All he can.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What, baby?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Hey!!
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
The?  Who the fff--
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Fuckin' A.
Sheesh.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Yes, heh--
Far from it.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Well...yeah--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Oh?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
So who--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Wooden bridge, huh?
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Who the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Look, man, did you--
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Yeah, and you were--
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Shit!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Employed?
Fuckin' A.
WHAT?!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Impressive.
He's half yours, partner.
Two years.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
What was that?
Recognize him?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Why do you hate us so much?
I don't like it.
Where were you, Whistler?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
His name is Jared Nomak.
Any casualties?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You're blind --
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
You used me as bait?!
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
What am I injecting you with?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
But you -- died --
Then what is it?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
That's weird --
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
How do you like that? Right on time.
Blade --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
--and if she ever did--
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What, are you alright?
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
No!
That's a joke?
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You don't want it though.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I can't.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
The witch?
Nice tent.
What about night?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
For "James?"
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Graduate Thesis--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
What?
Okay, but--
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Spite.
Enough to keep sane.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
What're you nuts--
Elly Kedward?
What?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Heather.
Yeah.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Anna--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Why?
....Ma'am?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Well... the couch would be all right...
Ray?... What time is it?
...Ray?
Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
Ray--
Thanks.
So how long have you know Meurice?
He needs a room, Dusty.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
What's the matter?
Got a job for you.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
This.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Got a problem, Meurice?
What?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Jeffrey?
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Is Sandy part of this?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Bull.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Nobody.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Do you like that?
Nothing. Are you alright?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank-
Frank is coming?
You. what?
Dorothy. no!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
Yes. I do.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
He got a little jealous.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah?
Goodnight.
Shoot.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Where to?
... You look beautiful.
... Sandy?.
No Jeffrey!!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you kidding?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What the fuck is that?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
What do you got there, Diego?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Because they caught me?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
I know.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
No more brothers, Diego.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Yeah, layaway.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
It would be my pleasure.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Power?
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I meant every word of it.
Source?  What about Derek?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Are we gonna split up?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Because she's visiting me.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Yeah?
It's not enough.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Are we good?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Sid Ahmed.
Second name.
You afraid of these ...?
What ... What must I decide?
I don't even know your name yet ...
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
How can I give you this statement?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Yeah.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What did they argue about?
What was the nature of the argument?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I've got work to do.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Rebecca Lawson.
What happened next?
It didn't.
Can you give the court an example?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
No.
No.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Then -- those are not your own words?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
I've been to a few -- yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
A.M -- or P.M.?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
I thought the subject was sex?
-- And then?
Hello?
Really?
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What's that for?
I'm dropping the case.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Why don't you talk to him now?
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
Yes.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Bar across the street.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
This time of year.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. How old?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Help cook?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Do you miss it?
You get used to it.
When?
You want to go back in?
What?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
You must get lonely at times.
You really don't need anyone?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Francesca?
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
How about if I set the table?
Nobody's asking you to.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
What were you like when you were younger?
Trouble. Why?
Sleep all right?
What?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What are you doing?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Yeah. It could get better.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Yes. And I've accepted.
You feeling better Franny?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
What happened?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
You want us to move in here?
Where's the others?
Climb out to where?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Let me see your hand.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
You know I can't.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
It's alright, baby.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
That place is already bad luck.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where is it?
We know how this was done, eh?
All part of the business.
Jesus, Caesar!
Caesar, what happened?
What are you going to do with it?
That doesn't make any sense.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
You murdered Gino!
Yes, I understand.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
A favor?
I knew it.
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
What do you want?
...  I needed that.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm glad you did.
We're not that different, Corky.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
It's in a case, on his desk.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Any bodyguards?
Why?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Johnnie, what did I say?
You're asking me a direct question?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
...they won't let you go...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
Keep it. 
Right.
Sir, you waited on line.

Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
I need a ride out of here.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I said ten thousand.
I won't hurt you.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
-- you could put it together --
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
And that's it?
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
xxxxxx...
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
...ergency procedures.
I think we'd better have a look.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
You don't have to sing it.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Yes, thanks.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
You stupid bastard!
Where do I get it stamped?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Are you alright?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
It's my fucking life.
Why not?
It's heavy.
Looking for you.
Really.
Turn around!
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Will you please turn back.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Oh God! What have we done?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Can I forget it?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
This isn't rare!
This is an emergency!
Hello ... hello ...
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
Pregnant.
You're going to live.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
You're not going to die.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
You never know.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Yes.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
The family know?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
How can that be? He was getting better.
I've taken that into consideration.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
Who with?
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
What's wrong with it?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
London.
You know what I...
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I didn't know you were going with him.
I lost six pounds...
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Just a few questions?
Just when do you start, telling people?
No...no.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Is everything all right?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
What?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  Not even you.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
If we could just eat first.
One year...almost one year.
Uh-huh.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I've got another story.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
What?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Why, you need me for the story?
So what did you think?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I got promoted for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Would you like to do me?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
You really like it?
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Is it murdered man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Walter...stay away from me!
Hi Walter...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
I know, man.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
It's hot in here...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
No...look I'm busy...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hello, Walter.
You're like an undercover guy!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
What's wrong with you!?!
I had him in my grasp.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
You're the guys from the movie!
Would you sleep with them?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Get away from here.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Excellent.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Nothing.
I thought we were meeting here.
Well, stay here tonight.
I didn't expect to see you.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Come again?
I'm going to the dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
That's me.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Excuse me for having something important to do.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
What, um...  What do we do?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
What?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
What!?!
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Wait!
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
The mark of the Coven.
You think so?
Write that down.
Well, I hope so.
Oh, God.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
How was that?
No.
I know what it is.
Yes I do...
I'm trying to play with your body!
--but you're father's in there!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
You're pulling your hips out.
Don't tell anybody.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
He' s confused--
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
I got released.
What?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Oh dear....easy honey...
You a God damn witch?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You spit on me!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
How come you don't like me?
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Naw...
Party without me.
What?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I'm going to the Show.
You're a great catcher.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Fear and ignorance.
And where can I go?
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
You were never my guest?!
Liar.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
He even played golf with the President.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Hey!
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Now this is just a signature card.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
They payin'?
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Hello.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Meet me at three.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You all right?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Yeah.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
You didn't have to beat him up!
No, you don't.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What's it...
Yeah.
He wanted a watch, too.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I should have -
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I wouldn't do that...
I wouldn't -
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you threaten me!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Should I let her in like - ?
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...Well, I've got a large family.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
So, you're a righty?
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Get out of here.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You shut up.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Sam?
Can I go in?
Can I go in?
Hey!
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Stay out of the way!
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
All right.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Hi, Jennifer.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
I can see that. Sure.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You're so nice. 
Nothin'.
Okay.
You know?
I did what you told me to.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
A sponsor.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm sorry.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
I just talked to him.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Listen...
Well, how come I laid nine?
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Take it easy, though.
Hi.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
We're waiting.
What do you want from me?
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
God-damn..
Car wash, Captain?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Hey, Captain God!
Maybe.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Can you make him stop!
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Will you let me explain!
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Who smashed the phone?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
My name is --
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Don't lay this on me!
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
A woman?
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
She's gone --
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Lucky for them they didn't.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
Yes.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
You timed that beautifully.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Did you hear that?
What's Nels' number?
Do you think they'll walk away?
That's a reasonable possibility.
What's your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
They saw you kill the driver.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Where do we meet?
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
There's two police cars now.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Five minutes.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Where's the backpack?
Who were you talking to?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
It takes all types.
He gave me a look.
He's back, Col
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
What was that all about?
No, I didn't --
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
Would you like a drink?
Must be in love to manage that.
Tell me about him.
What do you think?
I think you do.
Maybe.
What does that mean?
Can't leave me now.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
Tell him it hurt --
Sure I do.
Made me feel all funny inside.
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
So I'm sorry.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Please, Jimmy.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
It's a secret.
I had to go to work!
Are you supposed to take that many?
Tell me what she wore.
Not if you go.
Thirty-five.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Perfect.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
So he knows your name?
You sure about that?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Thank you, handsome.
You want to bet?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
Don't I know it.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
How different?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having two pints in the Rock.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
See if she's all right.
Go to sleep now.
Stop that talk now --
What you say, faster?
I never know nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
What is it?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Lord, you're stubborn.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I said, tell me to go to the --
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Yes -- ?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Sorry about that.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Back where?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Maybe.
Why?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
What are you doing?
The money is unimportant.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
You loved him?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I was, too.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
How's that?
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
On the street where you live.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
I believe what he said.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Ça alors! From Charles?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Why?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I think it's funny.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
She's my daughter, Tom.
is there anything you do?
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Not much further.
You know her?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
You're not?
You fucked me up!
You gave me a 'D'.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Then you should go.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Who?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
What?
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
I do not.
Are you coming to the party?
Go to the police station!
What are you doing?
I need to ask you something.
That's what he said.
Who is she?
Attacked how?
What?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
No.
You can't bring it.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?

help me get in the truck. 
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Huh?
What did I say?
...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
I got, uh....
Are you kiddin'?
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Am I missing somethin' here?
You stole this truck!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Take your gun!
 No...
...let live.
 
Holy shit...
...man!
...up!
Come on, old...
...we can make it.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

God, man!
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on.
Whoo!
Ho, ho...
 Shit. 
No.  Shit.
 Aw, shit  
Then stay...
No!

...-tion?
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
So I took his truck, yeah.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Not completely, anyway.
...shit.
Hey, hey, hey.




...on!

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
What'd you come back for?!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
I think so too.
No.
Yeah.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
But...
So...where's my truck?
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
You have my word on that.
"I am become Death, the...
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
"Went away."  I like that.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

...comes up that road.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?

...screwup?
...scientists.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...gear?
Assumptions are always...
I beg your pardon?
...the river.
Your fellow hero, untouched...




And don't give him any ice cream...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Forty-nine?
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
...back...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
You're the only one I can trust.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
I said let me see your hands now!
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
  All right.

Gimme this god-...

Look at that.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
It doesn't hurt.
Where from?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Avocado groves?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
No thanks.
Sure thing.
Off the alley.
I don't know...
I'll throw that in too.
Jake, listen.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's just lovely.
Oh yes.
I don't want it anymore.
Didn't you call?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
And why's that?
Matter of fact I do.
Well, let's go.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
A complete surprise?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
I should talk this over with your husband.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Is there anything else you want to know?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
No, I think I'd remember.
Why?
I know.
He owns it. You know?
What did he say?  What did he say?
It's possible.
What about?
What does it look like?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
That's good. Now what's her name?
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.
Come again?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
He was expecting you?
What about?
So he says you sent them?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
So what's that got to do with it?
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
I didn't see that.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
You know why?  She was so -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
That's Leland, isn't it?
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I intend to find out.
Oh yes, there is.
Oh!
You're very easily amused.
A chicken?
Oh, me -
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
I mean in New York.
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
Goodbye, Charlie.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Good.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Mr. Leland, you were -
Yes.
That must have been love.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Sure.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
How did you meet him?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Excuse me, but...
I think you'd better leave now.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
God, isn't he great?
You're kidding.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
Train. It took eight hours.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
So you're really getting married?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I just told you.
You don't have anything to do with it.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Sang.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Nobody. It was closed.
Excuse me?
That's easy to say from over here.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
You only brought one ball?!
You're late.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Eight and a half?
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
All right, Vader's boss...
There's more?
So they build another Death Star, right?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
What kind of show?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
No.
Thirty-seven!
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
I'm going to miss the game.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Exactly. They drank it all.
You know what Sanford told me? 
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
No, you're not.
If you go, I go.
How'd he die?
Oh, my god.
What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Why do I have this life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave me alone.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Yeah?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Maybe.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
What were you doing up so late?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
And I actually date you?
How many?
Why'd you hit me?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
He requested this?
You sucked that guy's dick?
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Sure.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
That's tight. Solid.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
No, I wasn't.
How long you gonna be here?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Which one?
Twenty bucks.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
I don't know.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Go on, fetch.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Gabe!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Remember the first time we came up here?
You attacked me.
A simple yes or no would have done.
No luck?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
What about you?!
Where's the helicopter?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You're looking at him.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
I don't know about totally.
Don't use my name!
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
You got what we need?
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Won't you join me, sir?
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Alex.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Thank you, sir.
What job and how much?
Helping you, sir?
Oh, aye, aye.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Moloko-plus.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
You like Bach?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Jesus...
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
You guys been holding hands?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
So?  It was a random thing.
Hi, Ma.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Yo, whassup?
You're kidding me.
He's not paying you one cent!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Who is this?
Yeah?  So?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Hello?
How long you think this'll take?
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Max.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Who's that?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Collateral damage.
I never learned jazz.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm not catching a melody.
Let's go.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
What'd they do?
That's the reason?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Any special reason?
The sound of love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
For what?
He says a dog bit his nose.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
So why are they after you?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You okay?
Pretty scary, huh?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
What are you doing?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
How did you know?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I don't know...
And you feel bad for it?
We're very specialized.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
Yeah, I do.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Yes, sir.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
You're --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
What is it?  What's happened?
Ellie.
No primer.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
There is no direct evidence, no.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who -- what -- are you?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Am I one... or many?
No more stalling, Captain.
You live here.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
A page-break signal.  A period.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I'd say this is slightly different.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
And?
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Ellie --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
I can't hear this now --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
What went wrong?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
I don't know, Boss.
You got your mind right, Luke?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man Oh Man.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
He'll never make it.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
You know where.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Nothing.
We've got another one.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Halloran.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Yes.  I have to go...
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Michael Johnson.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Sergeant?
Where you going?
Helen Hudson...
You got a suspect...
Or the F.B.I.?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
No.
You're kidding.
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
I want to see my mother immediately.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
And the party?
What about this one?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I'm only looking out for you.
Lie?
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Guess which hand.
No.
We're supposed to be asleep.
What's my rap?
Shocking, huh?
I wish I could have seen that.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Not a one.
Yeah.
No, I need some serious household advice.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
The restaurant, too?
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
Aunt Lily?
Michael, take it easy.
I guess so.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
What are you doing?
I think we need to talk about some things.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Oh.
I heard about your friend.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Where did they go?
It's Elvis...
Oui.
You're calling me on is phone?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
You don't trust me?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Uh, no --
I guess we're going to find out.
What kind of business?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Yeah.   We just go home.
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Anybody hungry?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
I'm from Belgium.
A thousand dollars?
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
What'd you guys find?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
No, I didn't.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
What the hell is he talking about?
Mr. Taylor?
Give it to me, Sami.
No.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
How's the arm?  Still sore?
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
You're home late... or should I say early?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Hello.  What is your name?
You don't seem to understand.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
How so?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Kneel!
You shouldn't have come.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Don't send me back!
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
A murderer?
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I don't know...
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
And you're gonna tell me who.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.
Fucking A, my friend.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Who?
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
That's ancient history.
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
We've got company.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Did you know Sebastian well?
You heard me.
I have his journal.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
You a lesbo?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Thank you.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
I do.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Am I bothering you?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Because I'm in love with you.
You really want to know?
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
What was that?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Are you for real?
Do you want to learn or not?
What do you mean?!
I did?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I look terrible.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
You think?
Need any company?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Who is this?
No.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
One.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
I don't find this very funny,
What are the terms?
Even there?
You would not believe what--
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Exactly the opposite.
Tell me all the details.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
No, I'm not.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I think you have your answer.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
How?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
Well, it seemed to me --
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Hello, Amy.
Did you mail then?
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
What'd you get for Christmas?
I'm your friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
But we don't have any sea weed.
Oh, how beautiful!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
May I pet the deer?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
It got hit.
And does he kill people?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Nearly four.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Translation: a total geek.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What did he say?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I've been here. What day is it?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.
Uh huh. So pee.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I'm sorry.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
Peter I love you too but...
I ate a guy last night.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
It's for you. Frida.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
He means the last that we know of.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What makes her think that?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
What?
Go on.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
You know something about me?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
You've been working too hard.
What is it?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Mild stroke?
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Bob...
Bob...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
I'm not sure.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
In the car.
What?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
They re not my attack dogs.
Oh... Hi.
Yeah.
What about it?
You mean with you and everything?
The Vice-President...
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
... How could I what?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
What?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Are you hungry?
What?
You have a lot of secrets.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Then why did you come here?
Quiet!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Tonight?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Datura.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
How long do we have to watch him?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Where are you going, Tyler?
What'dya get?
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Sounds boring to me.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
What?
Nuwanda?  Please?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Sure.
You what?!  How did you do that?
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Hello?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
But, Chris...
Just like that?!  You just knew?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
What is that?
Meeks.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Again!  Louder!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Yeah.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
Where are you going?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
Want to come to the study group?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
But if he said no before then...
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
I will be with thee straight.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Visit from my father.
Which question is that?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
The thieves.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Yeah you did...
What's the matter?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
I don't take orders at all.
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I have been.
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Let's go!!!
I do!!!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
But you must come in.
No. None of that.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
You mean...?
Linda, yeah.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Kind of. You didn't know?
Here.
Okay.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
You're going hunting?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Yeah.
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I'm doing that too.
We gotta play with more bullets.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Watch it, shithead!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
What?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Yeah.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
No.
Never one.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck I did!!!
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Mug sheets.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
You're crazy.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
See those guys?
I'll inform dispatch.
She's pretty.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Sanchez...?
...What are you talking about...?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
This little thing says I can't.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
-- in gold.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
You are afraid!
It's mine?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Oh!
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Mary --
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Consarn the consarn --
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Of course not --
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
The police...?
Where are you going?
What are you going to do?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Hans, he killed by brother --
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Three down, four to go --
They would, huh?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jenny?
I'm really shakey.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
I know!
Why you going to Algeria?
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You try calling the police?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
I can't talk to him.
What are you doin' in there?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
I want to talk to him.
What's the matter with you?
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You got kids?
What?
Where's the air conditioning?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
We like you, too.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
What is it, Sam?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
How did you know your son was involved?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Pure?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
What?
... The bodies out the door.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
He wants one.

Does that still go?
I'm here.
Bullshit!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Okay - you got your one.
I am.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
I forgot she's in here.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
Of course not ...
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Did it hurt?
Okay.
What?
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
That's the rumor on the street.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Cunt.
Stop it.
I said stop it.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
What did he do this time?
So?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
So, in other words, you are not down.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Mookie.
No, you the man.
Good morning.
Is it a good morning?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
It's gonna be hot today.
No.
I'm getting paid...
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Whatdafuck do you want?
Sal, I want my money.
We both do.
Keep it.
What?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
You talk to 'em.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
That's what you think?
Whaddup.  Money?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Just down the hall.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Hey look, it's our teacher.
The name's Walter.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I know I am, Mom.
I think it's just over there.
No, it's a treasure map.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Why not?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
What?
She did not.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
That's a cow, Harry.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Do you want me to pet your head?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
A raft.
It's okay. I want the rush.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Ready Lloyd?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
You're just jealous.
Why ith dat newth?
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
I'm so close I can feel it.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
How much homework is there?
Sure.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
What?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always?
Why do they come?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Don't you bave a car?
I have no next picture.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Who do I play?
That's good.  I could use the money.
Should I call a doctor?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Really?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
What are you doing?
And, cut...
I don't know.  Where?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Ed, it was only one review.
How long have you been doing this?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
This is my way of telling you --
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Would that work?
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
What was that?
Well you tried --
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
B-but it's our money --
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Do they show it?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
They celebrated the common person.
I'm moving out.
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Cool.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Uh-huh?
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Yes?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Who?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
I mean, that worked out.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
What's the difference?
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
Right, yeah --
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
She left.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Yeah...
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Well, when you put it that way.
That's lucky.
Um...
Twenty-nine.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Okay.
What did you do to your hair?
I'm making a tape.
What?
You would do this? You would actually --
What?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
No. What happened?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Look, we gotta talk.
What...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Do you still have it?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
How?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
What does that have to do with... ?
Sign here, please.
By the X.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, just --
Dick... Dick,..
What?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Mostly Tammy fans
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
I know.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Looks good to me.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Hello, Mr. M.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Plenty of pep, too.
What's this?
Okay, Jim. I understand.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I did it.
Exactly when?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Yeah.  I'm here.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
I also like bananas.
Where 're you going?
So?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
How'd she meet Patchett?
I'm not sure.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
Did you talk to Exley?
We talked.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
What happened?
How's it going to look on your report?
Lynn.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
She's fine.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Should I?
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Anything?
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
I never truck with no sissies!
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Why?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
L.A.P.D.
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
What?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
A vulgar term, but yes.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Where will you go?
When?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Do you have any proof?
Officer White?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Shut up!
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
And no one'll know about this?
Brill?
What happened?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Um...who's that?
Someone else?
Turn on CNN.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
I'm doing a transfer now.
Yes.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yeah.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
What do you think?
The NSA killed him.
Them.
<u>Here</u>?!
That wasn't so hard.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
He came in four minutes ago.
Baudmore Consultants.
What are you saying?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
I'll say.
Pardon?
Why?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Did he give you anything?
Something bad happened tonight.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
Yeah.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Oh, please--
Yes.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Actually, that's not true.
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Other than Brill.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I <u>did</u> care how.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Seat 74.
Robert--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She can't talk to you right now.
Some of 'em.
Dad!
No.
Bobby--
Yes.
Bobby--
I don't know!
Jerry--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Yeah.
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Hiding something?
I just meant--
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
No.
Excuse me?
I don't care to bargain.
I do not.
You should come into the shelter.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
You don't sew at all!
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Don't talk.
You're wearing the thimble.
Don't leave me!
A broken car?
Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
I see.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Which we've overflown twice.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Hello.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
The team is in mourning, darling.
Apprentices.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
How?  How can you see anything?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
No. But he hands them over.
Kip - come and dance with me
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
This is hot!
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's gone, hasn't he?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
I had a hotel room.
Go away.
Certainly not.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
This is wonderful!
Why?  Are you German?
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
You don't call, you don't write.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
Then don't.
You disappeared.
So what?
Do you mind?
You...you can't.
But Roki said--
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
It's a test.
What the hell do I do now?
It's one way.
That's entrapment.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
You're late.
And good morning.
I know it well.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
You bought this for me?
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we all.
One, two, three...
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
It's your mistake.
What?
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
That was a lifetime ago.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Put this on!
This is big enough.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You two make quite a couple.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Tonight your league night?
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
See you.
Where've you been?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Which one?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Oh, my God.
Any school you want.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
At least they made an offer.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Really?  It makes me sick.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
When?  Where?
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
When'd they file the demur?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
You are someone.
Thank you.
Think you could learn?
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
What's going on?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
You won't.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks his consternation.
Give me that!
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
What is it?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
I do not!
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
You look silly.
You look great.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
I'll take what's mine now.
Not really.
What's going on?
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
Jabba the Hutt?
I thought I was in good shape.
I don't believe it.
I feel cold.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Humans?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
He's... near.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Can you land?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Having second thoughts?
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
Does he know how to activate it?
No way.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Aw, come on, Snake.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Excalibur! Is it true?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
You freed it, son?
Who is, then?
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
To kill and be king, is that all?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
And you got an invitation.
Just five or six people.
What is it?
Me too.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Rats?
What!
Morning.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Convulsion?
So, what causes this?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Chris MacNeil?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Sure did.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What?
Is she gonna die?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh............
Yeah
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
What's playing.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Did you do that?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
And let my cry come unto thee.
What is it?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Really?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Fuck him!!!
You're not going to drive.
You're not going to drive!
Frankie.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
What about tomorrow?
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
What're you saying, Charlie?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Trunks?
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Teeth.
They're falling out.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
Two at a time?
Out.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Only on odd days.
No, I mean it.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Yeah?
Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
Sure, why not.
That's what we agreed.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Get out of here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
See anything?
So what do you think?
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Unless you want the right.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Christ, can't you hear it?
What's the matter with you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
The Royal.
No.
I don't know. Some disease.
You don't know?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Stay off it.
I didn't hear you come in.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So run a little longer.
Miss --
Where's my name?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
You two could play checkers.
I don't believe it.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Oh yeah?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Is that important?
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Yeah.
Black.  Labrador.
Frank works hard.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Forget it.
Every year.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
What's the matter?
How do you know?
The both of them?  In there?
So, what happened?
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
For what?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
Jon, what is it?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Now what?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Castor's escaped!
Commander, what are you doing here?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
You're wearing your suit --
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'm going to the powder room.
You?  Married?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
They did a pretty good job.
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
What are you doing?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Miss me, Jack?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
It would help me if we were.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
How’d you do this year, Tony?
For us, Kate.
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You want the cake!?
Jack.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
That’s a big one for me, too.
Good things...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Think bigger.
Are you out of your mind?
Don’t do that...
You’re moving...
You can’t go!
Don’t get on that plane!
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
I want to see you again.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
We had a tough year.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben --
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
What are you doing?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Oh, I think you already have.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Brain injury.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
Right, sir.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
As part of the Crew.
Doctor...
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
You must carry spare parts --
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
How does it look, Doctor?
You said there was a quick way out!
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
There it is!
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Atomic fuel?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Was there any damage?
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
What's this, sir?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Yeah, you already said that.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Personal matters.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Oh, yah, I know that!
How ya doin'?
What'd this guy look like anyways?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Can you be any more specific?
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah.
Ya got the car?
Yah, okay.
Norstars.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
You're darned tootin'!
Mm.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Where is everybody?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
No, that's okay.
Geez! You look great!
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
What'd he say?
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
And this guy is...
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
...Chief Gunderson?
Yah.
No, no.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
You are?!
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Why are you doing this?
In case we want to switch nights.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Where?  Here?
You... don't have to... leave.
Chloe's dead.
You hear that?
Hear what?
What is this?  Who did this?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
You are an insane person.
What happened... ?
Hello?
What?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
This is how I met --
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
What?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Huh?
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
The fight.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You?
You're sure?
Okay.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
It isn't... ?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
"Too young?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
What... ?
What about Marla?
...stop me?
Tyler...
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
S-S-Stuff.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Speed up.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Yeah?
Yeah, so what happened?
What's going on here?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Whoa, nine months?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Thirty-nine.
I don't.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
It broke!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Get control of yourself!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
Ninety.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Yeah.  Why not?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
We'll check it out.
How you doing, Brewer?
I thought he was with you.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Intelligence work.
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Why'd they want us?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
Look, Co...
Stay on your heading, Captain.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
All this is for us?
How long have you been setting up?
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
What did you want?
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
No, I'm fine... really...
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What are you two up to?
My agent.  I called my agent.
What?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
What if I was a relative?
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
Have I died?
That's O.K.
But I gave it to you!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
What?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
It sounds exciting.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
You're not going to play it again.
I did, didn' I, El?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
You like it?
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Alaska.
I don't make the rules.
Wasn't it, ladies?
I just can't look at you.
Oh.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Maybe you better stay, then.
Yeah, me, too...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
How long have you been staying here?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Where's Catherine?!
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Wait...
No, it isn't what I think.
That's right.
Just give me a chance, will you?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
It's a Borzoi.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
There's some good things on it, though.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Fine.
Then don't go out with me.
Victor.
Remember me, from the pool?
So wadda you do with your girls?
You look good.
How you treat them?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
Yo! What you goin' for
A girl named Amanda.
Unbelievable.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
You mean her.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Not a prayer.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Affirmative.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh my God!
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Why are they after you?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
I'm all ears.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Yo!
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Did you say cops?
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Preoccupied with what?
Who is it?
Hi.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
How do you know about that?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
You want I set up?
The door was unlocked.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
Where is she?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
You were going to can me, right?
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
You wish.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
How'd you get this from her?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Aha, just what I suspected!
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Three hundred.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Pretty smooth, huh?
Ick.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Well, hello, Ford.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's funny, you're cute.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
No - no.
Boca?
Doesn't register.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
What's your name, asshole?
Did you pick up the car?
I wasn't looking.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
When ya go back on?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Policy man in Queens.
The greaser with the blonde.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Why not?
What happened to you?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Why is it called Hellgate?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
They around?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
You alright?
Butch called.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Where's Johnny?
You give him his drops?
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Queens, New York.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What the hell...
You're still my Little Chief, right?
Fire.
Dad...?
She just died, your mother just died?
Murdered?  Why?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
I got it.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
He ain't our guy, John.
Are you a good cop, John?
Wife around?
No kiddin'?
Fuck you, asshole.
What was that?
How about a roll in the hay?
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Which one is it?
Derek... stop.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
What do you mean?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Hi.
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Got any good ideas?
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
I never said you were "nothing".
I thought that was the end of the song.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Whaddya mean?
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
My ass.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
What's goin' on?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Steven...
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Why did you want her body?
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
Does he know about what happened?
Oh my God, Steven.
I'm now begging you.
Well?
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
About what?
I'm literally going to kill you!
But she might be in trouble...
A major prick.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
But I thought...
What are you doing in here?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
She didn't push me into coming.
But Sean said...
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Everything okay?
I've got the numbers.
I heard you weren't coming.
I didn't mean for you to go!
But Rennie...
Crosstown.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
About what?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
What else?
Yes.
Mystery. Deception.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Who the hell cares?
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
Who is it?
I'm at the door.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Why do you care?
hat was this morning.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Yes.
I think I remember.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Oww!
Everyone takes his turn.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm sorry.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
What was he like?
What do you want?
Are you going to walk all the way?
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Er, no...
No?  What's keeping you?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
What a pity.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
We don't have the manpower.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
What about this?
Let's get out of here.
Call German.
Any particular reason?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Everybody goes there.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Anything I've forgotten?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
No.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
In the South Wing.
You didn't know?
What happened?
I've got enough here.
Flight got you nervous?
The name?  For the certificate.
I get my own help.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
What about your wife?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Where do you want to go?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
It's all right.
Wait... give me a minute.
I didn't. I just waited.
Doc...
Do you trust him?
I don't want to go there.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
What do we do?
Do you mean that?
What?
You're full of ifs.
Where are you going?
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Can we make it?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Where's home?
No, I'm not.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I'm good at that.
Which way?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You can trust him...
Can he trust you?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Why?
Jack?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
What was bugging Frank?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Do you?
He was here for four days.
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
Yeah.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
Working at Woolworths.
You work here, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where you off to?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Now just a minute...
Eric. Eric Paice.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
You should have told me who you were working for.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Ask me?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
I'm not?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
What?
They killed the goose.
And now...
Eh?
All of, they got you on this "board..."
...that's right...
He's doing very well.
I heard that they were running cold.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's what I...
What?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
As an idea.
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
Oh, yes, George.
No.
...I thought that we were only talking...
That's right.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
They stole the phones.
Yes.
You have nothing to hide.
Will you excuse...
Did they catch...?
That they're going to be upset.
Shelly: get in the office.
Go to lunch, George.
Excuse me, sir...
...did they...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Levene!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Mr. Levene...?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...I only...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Murray said...
Murray said...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
Mmm.
What are you talking about?
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Which...
You're sure?
Twelve-fifteen.
Rick...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Did I...?
Three days.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Have a good trip.
They didn't get my contracts.
They got, listen to me...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Yes.
I have the stuff from last year's...
...Mr. Williamson...
Yes.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
I saw him with you.
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
What's that?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
We have time.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Where's my wife?
Hello?
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I want it met.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Whose orders are these?
Where?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
He don't want to talk?
Are we going to eat or what?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It still hurt.  A lot.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
We have his note.
Good morning.
Nice place.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
These are your paintings?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Is this David's doing?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I didn't --
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't hear anything.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
But you said --
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
No.  It won't do.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Oh Clayton.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
More your line.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Does the yardman come today?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
No.  I expect you can't.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I was going to take a swim.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
You got no choice. It's over.
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I know you.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
You mean the poor --
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
You look good...
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
What do you say, Toby?,
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
You?
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
What era was that -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
You okay -- ?
What are you doing here?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
What the hell are you doing -- ?
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
That what you want?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Where to -- ?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Some crew you got ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
What do you want, shithead?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
My bag. My bag.
What bag?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Give'm a drink.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Stay there.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
All right, then.
She didn't do it again did she?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
She went to Medical school in California.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
No, I had to talk him down.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
WILL!
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Did she get my Double Burger?
Shut up.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
What'd you say about me?
I don't think I...Larry?
Good, it was all right.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
--that?--
Yes.
Yeah.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Can we do it at my office?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Who is he?
Well, she out did herself today...
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
You're right. I know.
I might understand that.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
That's very presumptuous.
You're getting defensive, Will.
You've never been out of Boston.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
I don't know.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Yes.
Gotta go with the belt there...
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
I'll keep in touch.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
You suck.
Yeah?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
I really don't 'date' that much.
Free?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I have twelve big brothers.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Some, a little.
No.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
At least you have a mother.
No, you don't want to hear that.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
Yeah.
Take care.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You bust outa jail, Tom?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Short fella. Pale face.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
You got dances too?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
No plants.
Where you think you're going?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
They know he got hit in the face.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Then who *do* we shoot?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
What's these?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Really...? So what?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Where have I been?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
What if I come back?
What stuff?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Okay.
Up on the right.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No harm no foul.
Hard to get good help these days.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
There you go. I left it blank.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Lisbon?
--Nooo--
It was the PLO.
I'm not happy.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Jim?
Ten years. What happened!?
He sold me this bad boy.
That's too bad.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Does Chicago count?
A jogger, huh?
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah.
Five years. My son was born here.
Why didn't it work out?
You missed a button.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Why don't you go lie down?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
Whatever you want.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Nothing.
When? Tonight?
Good.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I'm sorry.
We're very lucky.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Yeah.
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Frank's a good man.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Promise?
I understand, but Annie, please...
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
She gonna be long?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
You ever miss it?
Well, that'll happen.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Welcome to our show!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
She's rabid, but cute.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Right.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Blow me.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Crash Override.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
I said give me time.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Make it our first date.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Oh, wow, she's great.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Excuse me.
Hello?
Good.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Any questions?
Hello?
Congratulations.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Don't get angry.
Are you two okay?
Who's that?
Get back!
Brady! Come with us.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We should call the fire department.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Outside.
Watch it.
Night Doc.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Coming.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
What are you doing out here alone?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
We'll hear sirens soon.
You don't believe that do you?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
This is 132, over.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
How's it powered?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What happened?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Lies.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Yes, you can.
You locked yourself in.
I don't want to.
My parents won't be back till ten.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Sure...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
I don't like that story.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Yes.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
I couldn't if I tried.
...any sister talk?
Yeah.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Hmm?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
You--  Standards and Practices?
We--
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
How's everything?
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Poor Hannah.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Lee... uh...
No.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Oh, Mom!
How do you know?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Mm-hm.
What's the problem?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
You're just realizing this now?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Why?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
Yeah?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Ohh!
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
It's, uh, you never know--
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Really?
What's the matter?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Thanks for a swell time.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Come on.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, the reason I ask is--
You have.
Right.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Mmm, what?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
It's a growth business.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Who would that be.
Then I'm doing fine.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
...are you alright, sir...?
..It won't be long now, sir...
I've never heard that he...
I won't take much of his time.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...unmarked hundreds....
For a consideration.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
Waal...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
We got KittyKat...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
No, I don't get you...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...and that is what you need to expand.
...my love...
I am on the track of...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I know it well.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...I feel that...
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
For approval.
I don't understand.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
No, they're not from Wendy.
That would be a No.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
So what?                                                    ]
Hey.
Yes you do.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
God, you're beautiful.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Sorry Veronica.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
All right.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Something like that. Will you do it?
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No way, no day!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Chick-en.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Perrier water!
Did to.
Your son's dead and you love him.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
I think so, man.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
Come on through.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
He's the manager!
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Can I go now?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
Bye, Dad.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
Sure plenty of times.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Must be nice.
GWEN?
What's the occasion?
I've been in here before.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
You win! Okay pull over.
But... I thought...
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
What do you want?!
Do you know where you are?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You okay?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
It's November.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Yes.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I... I know that, John...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
John, I know all about it.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
That too.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What's "cynical"?
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Well, it's for a woman.
How's the new place?
Right.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Who doesn't?
Right.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Uh huh.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
What?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Huh?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
The cab's waiting!
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
He wasn't there.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Oh God.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Let's follow 'em.
And I can't help having a cold.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Do you see a man?
It's a double.
Really?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
What do you think?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
We don't have any proof of that.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
That's all?
I'm sure they will.
I'll go first.
I would like to say goodbye.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
I remember you.
To talk to you.
Yes.  How did you know?
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
You're twenty minutes late.
No.
Would you like to see it?
On the back it has--
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
How can that be?
You kept it?
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I can take care of myself.
What do you want to do?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Not if they're looking at something else.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
We been through that.  Forget it.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Now we can do whatever we want.
You gotta pee?
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
What's wrong with the radio?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
What?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
I think so.
What do you want me to do?
Can you get into the office?
What do you want?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
We, who is we?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes we have.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Will you protect us.
What is it?
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The United Nations are still here.
What did they say?
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
How so.
You will tell them the truth.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You fucking see that!
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
For supplies, you drive.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
That will take time.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
What!
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What do we do with all these people?
Where has all our beer gone?
Paul. Are you alright?
Out? Where are you going?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
There must be some other way out.
-- what was he doing here?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
What's down there?
-- the stained glass --
Why?
Most fun I've had all day.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Or an on-line computer.
Price!!
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Run.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Where is she?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I think...I may have the answer.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
I'll take my chances.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Don't know that it does.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Melissa...?
Sara...?
We don't have proof of that.
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
Can you talk to her?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
Where is she now?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
What will Aubrey think?
No.
What are you talking about?
I'm fine.
We don't know.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
You must be a Londrigan.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
So where is it?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
You gonna buy?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Joey?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I miss you too.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
How.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
I was the Warden?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Trust Leonardo....
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Way to go, Anna.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Remember that shoe you lost...
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Something short.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
-- and she's dynamite!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
What a horrible little person.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...You know! For kids!
Smitty.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
What a beautiful thought.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Sez who?
I filed it yesterday.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Well, I --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
Get up!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
Well, I made the dean's list.
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
...No money.
Good morning, miss.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Mrs. Rand.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
But it's so far away...
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
It's my day off.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I wish I hadn't heard --
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I often do.
I wanted to help you.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Benjie!
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
So early?
What?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
You think I --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Damn it, Ben --
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Hi dad.
Grades?
Hnnn.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Birth control.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Sure. Maybe coffee.
I saw you on your bike today.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Now you are being rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Do what?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
I do.
Mikey?
It's freezing.
You have to follow me?
When worlds collide.
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Hood residence.
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
The ones you built?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Vodka?
Good.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Then change it.
I don't remember.
Not really.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
What I saw?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
Good.
That's right.
Eight years.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
To do nothing.
That's right.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
One of your cases?
Hey...
It was like some big fucking secret!
What was it?
This an accident, Walter?
No back-up.
Nothing if not vampires...
You didn't even warm them, did you?
I want some more.
It will grow back again!
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Laudanum!
You want me to be a doll forever?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
You know her?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
He can protect us, Claudia.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Then my luck would have changed.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Give it to me!!!
Come, you're going to feed now.
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
And if I don't?
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
I don't pretend to know.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Unless I make her one of us...
She's here, your wounded one.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I have to go now Lestat...
I tried...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Did he die in the fire?
No... it can't end like that...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
You're in 201 and 202.
What about a radio?
Get lost, you scared me.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Hello? Hello?
Nice move.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Julie...
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Who?
I'm fine.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Hey --
Ahh, that feels great.
How much?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
How's the water?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
What if he is?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
You know that sound, Oliver?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army —— they need you.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
You what? To save me?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Made what?
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
A boy?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Hi, Daddy.
It will?
Hmmmm . . .
No.
Oh . . .
Well, no younger than I was.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Hey, George . . .
No, George, don't . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Me?
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
I'll take it. And then what?
Didn't you tell her?
Tuesday.
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Where's your coat and hat?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
What plates?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How about that one there?
Oh, shit.
Yeah, it's her job.
Is she responsible for the punch?
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Hey!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Because.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
You said something about a camera.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
The Shark's mouth.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
What makes you think there might be?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Late.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Need a ride?
Hey!  That's my boss!
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Oww!
Careful.  What's wrong?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I know you did....
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
It's still a good idea.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Hi Dad.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
It killed her.  It ate her.
Terry!  You okay?
Nope.
Maybe it's gone.
Shut up.
Come on back up here!
What about the others?
Hurry, please.
About damn time.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
When are we going out?  You and me?
Eat Cheerios.
You're going out.
Yeah.
Oh, my God....
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
He's going with you, Doctor.
No.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
You called, Doctor?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
It's romantic down here.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
What's that?
You want me to stay?
What's up?
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
It's too soon to move him.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Me.
But you --
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
He's missing.
Don't you dare.
Buzz off.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
What kind of trouble?
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Thea....
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Can I make sandwiches...?
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Turn it off....
Off....
Where have you been...?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I can't help it....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
We'll be there....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
I'm hungry, Mom....
I almost forgot....
I'll be all right, Michael.
There's nothing to worry about....
I don't want to talk about that.
It got him....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I don't know how....
How do you like flying?
You're always taking time off....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Why?
I'll get it back next time.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Feathers all over the place....
They put bombs on dolphins....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
When I got the grant.....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Hoagie.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
'Snuck up on me....'
I don't like the song.
All the time....
Here it comes....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I'll take care of it.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Yeah, he can go ...
You gotta stop smoking ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Can I see your hands?
Did Amber have a dog?
What color was it?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I know what you're like ..
Really? What did he say?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
It's not possible right now.
You think John would like it?
You want something, darling?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Ugh!
This can't be happening to me.
I just heard.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Could you just stop moving?
Listen to me!
There is something missing here.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
You think so?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
What?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
It's my fault.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
That's the girl I love.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, thank you.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Said who?  Sugar?
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Rod --
You are not allowed to act this way.
Uh, not today, but --
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
That's an answer.
Damn right.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Why not --
I think so.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You...
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
I won't tell.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
He says it's a bad idea!
You look good.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Nothing.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
I CAN GET HIM!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Know what this is?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
I want to be an astronaut.
You should.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
I have never been on this island!
How did you know?
It doesn't matter what I think.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
I don't even know this woman.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Well, is he?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You version of it.
Our chance to do what?
No.
Something's wrong.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
So what's your story, Nick?
You think this is all a joke?
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
-- way we could safely --
Hold it down, Nick!
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
What?
The door security systems are shutting down.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Phones are out too.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Did I say jerk?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
They smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
The movement!
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's all right.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
It's anti-nature.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Faster, faster!
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Tim.
No.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
What'd I touch?!
Machines hate you?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Can't you stop these things?!
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Your silence intrigues me.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
No, but...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I don't know...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He wets the bed?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
None of that's true?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Me too. I'm drunk.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Where's he going?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
It's what I'm paid to do.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
And you ...?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You don't believe that.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
I don't know.
No, I suppose not.
What makes you think so?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
Do you?
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
This is filed incorrectly!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
What have you got there?
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I'm sorry ...
Can you fly?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Coz of something I lost.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Do you always have to repeat?
You think people hate you.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
What was better? I made better bait?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
-- Tuscarora --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
What? This?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Well do you think it was him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
I don't see anything, do you?
Try some other ways. 
You said it was!
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
We did this before.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
You and I -- a relationship.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Where, how?
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Nobody's seen that.
Mr. Kramer?
The prospect of losing my child.
What do you have here, Billy?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about her?
What do you like best about your daddy?
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Uh huh...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
You're no bargain either, pal.
It's my name too.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Uh, huh?
Your mom.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Objection!
No.
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Where are you going?
You have?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
You want what?!
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Yes, what?
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
No.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
California?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Thelma, if I die--
Please, come, Holiness.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
I have.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
Holiness?
I need to squeeze this brain.
What do you think?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
I will not go.
Good day.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
This is Britain.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
You will not come?
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
I will miss you.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
How could I ever leave?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
No.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
I'll sue you.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
I got something on the screen.
Where?  Where?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Never been to Maine before?
Who?
In Maine?
It's too dangerous for--
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Really--
Calm down.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Okay.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
You said nobody came in here!
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
I'm fine, thank you.
Seconds.  Three, four.
You're sort of a rude person.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
You think Jack's handsome?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
A jerk.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
What girl?
Sometimes.
Get me out!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Who's the subject?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Yes sir.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Did you ever work with her?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I never thought about it.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Where were you going?
Yes. I'll tell you.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
How did you learn English?
Are we safe?
There was no letter.
You do not know what you are saying!
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
I see...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Who were these people?
Ottawa!
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
We don't.
Then what?
Any powder?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Got a reason to stay.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
And what is that?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Wampum?
Yes.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Yes.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
What's wrong?
Why Sixpack?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
You did good...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Excuse me, sir...
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Not yet.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Yes sir...
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
What is it?
Who were you talking to?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Apart from those shotguns.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I don't know what you mean.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
How long has he been in there, son?
That's no way to answer the phone.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
And the weed?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
I hope this is the right move.
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
Tom?
I want your bar.
And?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What are you doing, Plank?
You know how much it is, Nick.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
That isn't true.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I'm sorry, sir.
The--the officers.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
I hear they're closing that post down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
That badge--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Do I seem jumpy?
You look good--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
You were in a fight--
Same weight I always was.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
350 pounds.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
He a Black man or an Indian?
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Dad--?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
You wouldn't?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Seems like we have another one every week.
When we backed you--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
I got an idea what happened.
Do you?
The Perdido thing?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Mrs. Bledsoe?
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
He squeezed money out of you?
And my father?
What?
Yeah?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Yeah.
How long have you lived here?
What was your father's name?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
The shooter local?
I been working on a few things.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
You sell much out here?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
You going to tell him?
He's gonna find out.
Mister D'Amour?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Don't.
Anything?
Yes...
Did your husband know Quaid?
You don't believe me.
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
He was the real thing, right?
No.
I wasn't.
What the fuck?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
And this Butterfield guy--
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
It's one in the afternoon.
Mine.
I saw him in Vegas once.
I don't think the dead much care.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Don't bother.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What's her problem?
Does anybody?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Not true.
Yes.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
What about you? Why are you here?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, its easy.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
That's ok.
That's too scary.
You think so?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Well... have a good flight.
Lydia?
Hello?
Not all that pasta.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Excuse me?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
You wanna come?
Sure.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
It's amazing  there!
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
I spaced out.
And how would you describe him?
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
It's nothing.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
No, I wasn't, actually.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
He spoke to you?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
What?!?!
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
I don't understand what's going on.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Good of you to stop by.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
She told me she killed them.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
How is he?
Whatever.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Are you okay?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
Wait...
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
No one's forcing her.
He's in college?
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Just wanted to say good game.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
So how come you could play basketball?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
What's that?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
He ain't Spalding.
Early night for you, isn't it?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
That was so weak.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
You want to go talk?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
A rest?
You asked me what was missing.
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
No.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
We were just studying.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Later when?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
You know, people.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Tell me what?
Sorry.
So what are you gonna do?
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Yeah.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
I'm here, I'm listening.
Does this sound weird?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
What the fuck do you want?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
For what?
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Who was it?
You take cream or sugar?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
What's that stand for?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
So you've done it --
You wanna make a deal with me?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
I'm sorry.
It's ok.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Ready to go,go,go?
It's upstairs.
Have you ever been there?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
Son, please, now....
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
....do you know who I am?
What?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You see?
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I paid you back.
Yes I do.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
-- memory?
I think you have the wrong number.
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
the valley?
Why does that sound silly?
people die.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Is he in pain?
It's interesting.
...ok...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
Are you lyin' to me?
No I Said.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I preffer to stand.
No.
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
You want her right now?
Did you tell her?
How do we do this, then?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Was there anyone that I know?
How long with Ellen?
Do you have any children with anyone?
I don't.
Do you know the answer to this?
Hello?
Can I come in?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
What's MOW?
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Pink Dot.
What would you like?
Water.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Yes.
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
This happens....this is something that happens.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
But -- what is he doing?
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Where are you going?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Are you hungry?
Your Majesty has had many women --
Phillippe!
Food, moron.
Exactly why it should be given away.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
What can I do for you?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
We're by Ozone...
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Up north.
No.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Yeah.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
You must be going somewhere.
What's the bottom line?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
The mark? Yes.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
I'll pick you up in...
'Changes?'
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
It's not over yet.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
How did you come to Gateway?
Yes, are you okay...?!
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
What am I doing here?
I don't want to know.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
'No' what?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You will tell the truth?
Do you have it?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Yeah...
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
I don't think I'll tell you.
Most people are.
He only bit women so far, right?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
I call him a monster.
Molly?
Hello, hotshot!
At the store. You doin' some good?
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
I remember.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Hello.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
That's not true.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
How?
...after a while.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
No.
I hope you have a second chance...
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Really?
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
What do you mean?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Are you at peace with your family?
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Can I help you with something?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Lieutenant?
That's the third white van I've seen.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
He had an accident.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
How?
Yes.
All right --
Give me your phone.
What do you know?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How does she know?
She helped you?
How...?!
You're the Oracle?
But what?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
Should I be?
What did she tell you?
That I would have to make a choice...
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Neo, how did you do that?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
You don't have...
Zion?
What are you talking about?
Cypher, I thought --
What the hell just happened?
What just happened?
Uh...can we give you a check?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Kennedy.
Nervous?
You flew before?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
And say what?
Panther...
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
I don't like loading crates.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Where's the rest?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Did you?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Sure...He lives there?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Well...no.
Just keep him quiet.
How much?
Yeah.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Hi, Allison --
I know you do, darling.
What is this?
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
Honey, please.
Honey --!
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Yes, sir?
I would prefer some peanut butter.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
Sounds good.
'Just kidding'?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
In English, please.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
He said that?
I from dat nex' place.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
How long you here, Joe?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
I am Joe.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I mean I appreciate that.
Almost.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
For how long?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Bill --
I want to live.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
What's okay?
I was just asking, Bill.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You are --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
I'm sorry --
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Next week?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
I hope so.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
You're terrible.
What?!
Nothing.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
You don't know anything about Joe --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I love him.
What a night.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I could be her.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Did I say something wrong?
Why?
78.
Hiya.
You don't know?
My wife.
What makes you think he's my friend?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
A cop?
You know him?
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Why?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
How do I know he did that to you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What's wrong?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I'm not appealing the decision.
Mr Gammell?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Unfinished business.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Like what?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
No. You took them out.						  *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
I was the kids' godfather.
Oh, yeah...
Where's the new drop point...?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
25% discount on the load.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
What do you like to drink?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Where's she now?
That's right.
Is it December?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Stevens?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Anything?
Like...?
Verdado.
Havana, Cuba...?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
What's your take?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
...and thanks for the flowers.
Define small.
Equipment?
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Lotta rich women back there...
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
No, ma'am, I'm not.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Yeah, well, so?
What of?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I read it.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
You want me to leave?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Gonna be like money from home.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
... and taxi fare for me.
Two kilos.
Where?
Tunnel?
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
I'll pay extra
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
But just...
How much did you have?
How long?
Hello, Billy.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Okay?
What?  You gotta be joking.
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Mr. Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
Jeremy...
And a right.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
We'll be back at the platform in...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid's with them!!
He's special.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
If you wouldn't mind.
What's it about?
The profanity bothers you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
My daughter must be going nuts.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
I want my pills NOW!
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
You're still a writer.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, please.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Nyah!
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Ninety-three point four million.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
They've got a book for everything.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Damn, you're beautiful.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
I don't.
You don't trust me.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
Like what?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Only four more cars.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
The message is for Job.
Theyíre dead.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Kittridge.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
What makes you trust me?
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Where exactly is it?
Zero body count.
Merci.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
You're going to use Walter?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Itís not working.
The Shawfish?
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Where's Ma?
What's your news?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
It's wrong to just let them go.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yes!
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
He knew my husband who died.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Yes.
What are you doing!
Because I have no Luck!
I was dead.
Your blood.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
That light.
What? What have we done?
She didn't like me.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Why not?
Why?
Why not?
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
How near is she to death?
You have a brother?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Oh.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
He should pay.
So.
Where is she?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?
I'm sure she did.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Yes.
Yes.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
How do you know she is a witch?
Burn her anyway.
I see.  Yes, of course.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
Oh, please!
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
Well, what's that then?
You're a liar.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Had enough ... ?
All right, we'll call it a draw.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Where?
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Yes, Lord.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
I think I'll go for a walk.
What is your favorite colour?
That's easy!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I can't.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Why?
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Listen, Alice ...
Who are you?
I was saved at the last minute.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
The Castle Anthrax?
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
What are you doing?!
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
I hope to go up next year.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
Of course.
A situation?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It is quite late enough.
How will I know?
I'm sorry?
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Is that not enough?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Again?
What do they want?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
How do you do that?
He?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Yeah...
Happy?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
So how did it know my name, then?
Well?
Where to now?
Then leave her.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
SLIP-STREAM.
Jesus Christ!
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
Cool.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
There is no problem.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
A car ... a car accident.
Very pleased to meet you.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
No. I can't.
Number 17.
I don't think...
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Betty Elms.
Yeah, what for?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Nice wallets.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Where are we ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I'm listening.
What's the trick here ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
You okay ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
I thought you made this place ?
What ?
Not yet.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
What's wrong ?
So ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Well ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Of course.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
No I am not.
So who are these people with the Boss ?
Bruce has just awaken.
Thank you.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Umm, where do you want this?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
You want me to move?
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
No nuns, got it.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I don't know if I want to.
Never heard of him. 
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Oh.  Ohhh?
More than anything in the world.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
You're over reacting!
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Where are you going???
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Ten bucks.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed.
Well maybe for you.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
But Dad'll never go for it.
He's so tiny.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Uh huh?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her?
Did she ever see Vada?
It's only eight o'clock.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Ahem.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Dad?
What?
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
I like the freak show.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Will you tell her I came by?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
He likes her.
Who's winning?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Did you read ALL these books?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
What are you saving for?
No, I'm going home.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Yes.
What do you think it's like?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Why are you running away?
I don't like her.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
For what?
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
What?
We'll never be the same.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Needing.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
And the answer was so simple.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
I saw the show.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I think he's been fired.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
I never eat when I'm serene.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Where did we first hear th...
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
This thing means that much to y...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Well.  How come she didn't...
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Well, if that's the way you f...
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got the money?
What do you have to buy?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You have to what?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
What do you really want?
You know better than that.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
How much?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Your brother?
Harvard?
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
What?
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
No.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
And before?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Wow!
Wrong.
I knew when I first met you.
What?
I can do benefits
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
No, we never did that
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What did you think then?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Naw, she don't mind.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Are we in a big hurry?
By all means, knock yourself out.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
It's video.
Ready.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Yours.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Then was it worth it?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
No. Not really.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Roger?
Who?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
It's gonna be beautiful.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Could we go with you and film it?
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
No thanks.
It sure is.
You think so, Frankie?
'You Duff Anderson?
Used to be. On the railroad.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
What d'you want?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
I don't know. He's your boy.
His profession?
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
No thanks.
They must work on the section gang.
How d'you mean?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Not here, Duff.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Surprised?
That's right.
What happened, Duff?
He could live with us.
Huh?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
You will.
They won't.
You heard me!
Duff, I love you.
There's nothing to say.
What's so hot 'round town?
I'm Duff.
How about a drink?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
She don't look no worse to me.
Come back some other time, will you?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I understand.
Hi.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
I ain't drunk, honey.
You hate Raoul?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
What are you doing in here?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Did you trace it?
What about McCoy?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
What are you talking about?
Tell me the words.
I don't have a girl.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Ready?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Case.
Case... are you okay?
I had to limit your options.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
I know.
Is he going to make it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
My God... these people are insane.
What?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Yes, it's lame.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Now this is cute.
Wings?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
That's your story!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Is that true?
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
Thanks. And what are -
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You remember that story?
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
Boys.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Oh--yikes!
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
We followed your instructions.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
No.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
I'm sorry...
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Disappointed?
Whoa!
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
What's so funny?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
You're going out?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'm serious.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Watching TV.
I used to live in this house.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Try me.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Who would know where they were hidden?
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
Science...I suppose.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
How is he?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Why is he after us?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.
Really, no.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
That's fine.
You abide by rules like that?
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's spectacularly unfair.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Yes.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Cappuccino as ordered.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
No, 'fraid not.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
How was she?
Fabulous.
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Y-y-y-yes...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Who? Tell me!
Yes, ma'am.
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
That's it! We made it!
I hope everything is settled.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Yeah, kid?
Say... God Bless America!
Ca-na-da...
Let me get on your shoulders.
They went that way.
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Martini!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
It doesn't help him.
I refuse!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
Gimme a cigarette!
Why not?
Yesterday...
Hit me!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
He's not!
Is that so?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
You think it's funny, huh?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Oh, yeah?
Somebody's coming!
What are they?
Yes, I see it! I see it!
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Whew! Hiya, boys!
That!
Oh, yeah...
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
No, really.  What's she doing?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Good.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
There is one other thing you should know about me.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
NO.
Why are you asking me this?
So?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Mickey Spillane?
So.  You found him.
What are you doing here?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
I'm sorry.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
What would you call it?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Just since yesterday.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Is everything okay?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
It's still the new year...
What?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
We're saved!
What is it?
Your brother?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Her brother.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
...and a fortune teller.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Maybe I can change him.
So...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
You miss me?...
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
I have to talk to her.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Good strategy.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Wow... .
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Terry...?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
What for?
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What are you going to do?
I've been sittin' in the church.
Terry— what's happening to you?
What I did to Joey.
Terry, no, no... .
He's going to have to grow up too.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
I don't get it!
What are you going to do?
A question of who rides who.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
So help me God!
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Better.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
My favorite little cousin.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'—?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
She was?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Ahh, she will be yours.
I will decide the conclusion.
Then cancel my order.
Your pleasures of course!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yes.
Why not?
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Do we need him?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
You know they gonna set us up.
Come <i>on</i>.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Quite a mess.
No, I didn't know that.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
I thought so, too.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Of course I am.
We still talk, though.
Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Peter Finch.
Bleeding on a country road.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
Those guys bother you?
You like bourbon?
Love it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You're not dumb.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
You think he's lying?
I see better with them on.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Weren't you expecting us?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Can I do what?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
He said he stayed here last November.
Thanks, Dad.
Dad...
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You wave back?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
You're Walker, right?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You liked that?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Nah, you go on.
We gotta face some facts here.
What's there?
You were more like brothers.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well sure, Colonel --
Sorry to trouble you.
What's your name?
Thank you, 'Mam.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
I'm not telling.
Let's go.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't get it.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Want me to drive you home later?
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What am I going to do with you?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Does this mean you like me again?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
What would that be, sir?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
This morning was good.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
Would you get that, dear?
What do you mean?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Where have you been?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
You're giving me the creeps.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
I was building a doggy door.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
What do you mean?
Jesus.
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Thanks, Walter.
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
Continue.
My lover and I.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
A regular all-American guy?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Some do. I didn't.
That's right.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Mom?
Were you recently promoted?
Objection!
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Oh, Lord....
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
You did this? To yourself?
They're coming.
Entered our minds.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
How many you see?
One or two.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Here. Make it easy on you.
What do my eyes see?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Big Evil?
Didn't bite.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
How much?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Hasan?
Think about that reward, Johns.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
An' this?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
The best. But we won't need them.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Do you have to work tonight?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
The evidence was very meager --
How did it go?
Yo!
No.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
He's trying to form words.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
It's no use ... there she goes.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
One is in a museum!
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Read it yourself.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Of course.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Yes.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
What?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Feel good?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I didn't like it.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
They might think I was running away from something.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Your liquor laws..
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
I don't.
You tried to run away.
Cold?
All right--following me.
Why?
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
See anything?
Wonder what?
Including Killaine.
In a way.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
You've had dealings with the police before?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
If I understand what you meant by that.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
We know everything.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
What?
Round of golf Saturday?
Thank you.
How about a cup of coffee?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Did I do something wrong?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
You nasty, sardonic--
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Do I know who lives down there?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
How about Magruder?
Who's the girl?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
What's this?
I told you she's just..
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
To Ann.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Thank you.
Can I give you a lift?
And you're at this third stage
Me too.
Jeremy phoned this morning
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
I'm waiting for your mother.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
What about the Cromwells?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
No, thanks Dad.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
You'd look naked without one.
No.
And that's why you never went pro?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Where's Roach?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I'm serious.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Why us?
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
We can reach an understanding on this.
You don't know anything about me.
Storage, I think.
You what?
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Mr. Harris.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
What's your name?
It pays.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
The Rex.
I think you'll approve.
Why not?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
What about dinner?
I think it's exciting.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
You won't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  I'm glad.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
I'm here.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Vivian's in sales.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
You're being ridiculous.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
I leave extras, miss.
And who is that?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
You'll like it fine.
What if they serve soup?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Yeah.  Thanks.
Then why bother curing me?
Every ship but the four you sent.
Who are you?
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
Of course you will.
Can you move at all?
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
What?
Hello.
-- what? --
You've been mostly dead all day.
What?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
-- wait, just wait --
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Rise and report.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
Yes.
Where's Fezzik?
Hah?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
No one of consequence.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You're just stalling now.
Bye-bye, boys.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"Of the silvery moon,
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Do the books!  Do the books!
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
Yes, it's quite possible.
What???
Will you get a hold on yourself.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Do you need us?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Get car.  Get car.
We can't play today?
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
The Blue Max...
Where are you going vit the light?
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
What?
Cash.
Anyone at home?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Five hundred.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
With the forty thousand dollars?
Lila.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I was getting to that!
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Probably on his way back right now.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Does that mean we can't...
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Huh?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
You can't go up there.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Can you?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I can come down next week.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
Is there?
Oh?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Barefaced.
My mother is not dead!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
You didn't find anything.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
No?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
What are you laughing at?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I won't let you say that!
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
What! What are you talking about?
It happens that I'm the law.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
We'll grant that.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Is that a fact?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Of what?
Is Rose here?
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
In what sense were they bad?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
What is it, Rose?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
I got an awful toothache.
He did?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
No, son, she is dead.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
How goes it, darlin'?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Is anything wrong?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
I don't believe it.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Incestuous.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Now you know what to watch for...
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I need the "when" and the "where."
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Where you gonna be?
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Dean Martin.
What about him?
Where we going?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
That's him alright.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
He tried to kill us.
Our resignations.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Well, sir...
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
We got him.
Oh yeah?
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
No more counting the big money for someone else.
This shit was Ming.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
They are clear, my Master.
Are you all right?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Hey!
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Yes.
Proper?!
What did he say?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
I'm going in.
Ugh!
Then you know why I have to face him.
There is no conflict.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
How many languages do you speak?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Janet.
Yes Brad.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh Janet
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
You're OK by me.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Now I
Oh my, my,
Dealing
No no no, no no.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I don't think you're a bum.
Morning after?
Yes.
Why?
Would ya take off your glasses?
...What?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You busted?!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Hear she's retarded.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
That's ten bucks.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Bob.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Ya still light seventy.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Sparrin'?
What?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah.
Come July, twenty-five.
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
When was they here?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Yeah.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Ya got heart.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Wanna keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
It ain't your locker no more.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
...Sure.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
It don't bother me none.
...Tight.
Whatta you think?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Surprised?
Toon cops worked me over.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Where is he?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
I got him on loan from Disney.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Me.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Safe?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Two bits.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Hold Daughter!
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Goodnight.
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Amen
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
We kept it...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Who the fuck are you?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Not to me, you know that.
Is that right?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
I didn't say I was.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
I'd stake my reputation.
Don't do it, Sam!
He's company.
Where's my information?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
We'll die if we stay here!
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Nobody's going to do that!
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
So this is what, a test?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
He says this is their block.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
Lovely, isn't it?
It was at that.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You better get some sleep, alright?
You sure?
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
Can you get it?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
That's not what I mean.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
How long is it going to take?!
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Nothing happened?
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
How are we going to do all this?
I don't know.  My friends...
What makes you say that?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Just goes to show you.
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne please calm down!
You're never getting that much.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Oh, you American?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
What's wrong?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Carter?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Good at what?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
It sounds impossible --
You said --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
You pull a muscle or something?
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
No.  It was my singing.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Steamed dumplings?
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Is this a payoff?
Put your arms around me.
Any leads?
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
You know what a phone booth is?!
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Sir, I can explain.
Feds asked for me?
It's the same thing!
We are both full of shit.
Witnesses.
You make the plate?
No.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
This concrete?  This is still America.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
The Feds?!
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Jesus...what do you want?
I'm talking about the girl.
Hmmmm?
Shut up!
My daughter.
Yes.
You have what I asked for?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I still have work to do here.
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm not running.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
And you defending her?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
They made me put my hat back on.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Like her mother.
You afraid to try?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
About a minute...?
You were not.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
Reporter?
I'm going to kill myself.
But I'm weird.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
What happened at the luau?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
-- who's married to --
Is that all right with you?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
What was that about up there?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
No.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
It's probably just the flowers --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Hello.
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
All righ...
Why not?
No.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Eighty dollars.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Whose show was this on?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I don't know.
It's a sign.
I was thirsty.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Do you like it?
Hi.
Yes?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Oh.
He's ten.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
You haven't tried locking them up!
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
They say I am no good to you.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
You weren't waiting for me.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Will you be still?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Are you Australian?
Bobby?
What can I do for you?
Not even a guess?
You like that?
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
What?
I can't.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Why don't you call the cops?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
He knows where I work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
What's wrong, Danny?
That's a good one.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
He doesn't have one.
You want a hit?
Okay
When? When did you ever see me use?
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Danny, I'm touched.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
To who?
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Excuse me?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
There's no motels around here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You mean like the Donner Party?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
Spit it out, Captain.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
We left them eighty-eights.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
I wonder where they're going.
What about our grenades?
What'd you say, Captain?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Since when have things been normal?
You think they'll be alright?
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
I don't think so, Captain.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Ours is not to reason why.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Thanks, I like yours too.
C'mon Lloyd.
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Ha!
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Lloyd?
Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
I'll go.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
It's just you and your dad, right?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Then call me tomorrow.
I'm doing alright.
You're shaking.
I don't think I am.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
It was wonderful.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
No, I don't, I don't.
No I didn't.
Did you talk to Corey?
What do you want?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
It's your castle, man.
Uh... okay... um...
Are you?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Oh, I was just going to...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Give me my firebird keys!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
You know what, you'd like her.
What?
It's bad business.
Scherner told me something else about you.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
I just told you.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Yeah.
What others?
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Christmas presents.
I got to go, I'll see you.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I think it's too late.
I'll talk to you later.
Would it do any good?
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
We know that, son.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
thought he was doing AA.
What? I can't hear you...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
I did that.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Finish what my son started.
I think he's doing Dolly.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Why?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
You’re the one who got away.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
I see you read the book.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
..and as lonely as I am...
Oh my God. How could it happen?
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
What?
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
..this week's TKE kegger...
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Melinda McGraw?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
I can see nothing's changed.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
They've got her!
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Sidney, what happened?
But you know who she was.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Basements creep me out.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
What'd he say?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
I'm hanging up right now.
No.
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Owwww...
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Dude. What are you doing here?
She can't get both of us.
You rode your bike out there?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
You lost your mom...
Or even a good porno.
What?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Who is this?
Do I?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Popcorn.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
That's not what you said.
You getting scared?
How do you know his name?
No...
No...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
What is she doing here?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She's tough.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Are you okay?
Stu was with me last night.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
You're crazy -- both of you.
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
Who?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
I don't believe it.
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Delusions of grandeur.
You just met me.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Punishing.
Did you read them?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
And you don't?
How did the fire fight end?
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
And so what?
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
You got to be kidding.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
Where's the victory?
Put your gun down!!
I don't know why... why now?
How long have you lived here?
It's a hard place.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Another one, eh?
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
What good does that do?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That don't make 'em kin...
He just couldn't wait...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Stay out here.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
We got two around that age...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Who's that?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
What?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
But what is the truth?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
You are a gentleman.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The title?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
On my mother's side the Ardens
God be praised!  Locked?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Where are you going?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
The show must … you know
Go on.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
And yours?
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
This is a different one.
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Be good to her, my lord!
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Master Shakespeare
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
My lady!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
And that was only my first try.
No…no.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
How does it?
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
I am going to church.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
Is there a man?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You mean immoral.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
I don't hear this.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
You're not eating.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
Don't know what?
Well, is it?
What?
Yes, thanks.
Cameron.
Yes.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Well, she had problems --
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Who was it?
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Yes.
I don't thinkI can.
Stop nagging.
Who?
Hello. Hello.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
No.
You'll wait in the hall?
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, nothing, sorry.
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Would you like to talk about it?
Who have you talked to?
No one.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy?
Here?.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Do you think you could answer that?
Shall I answer it?
Yes.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Why?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
She's got a...
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
Your husband?
What about?
I hope she's all right.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
That headboard.
I guess so.
No thanks.
... yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Right.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
I guess not...
Yeah.
I've got heads here, Norman.
So how's Norman?
You would?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Did you?
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
Where do you want to go?
Sammy's?
-- what?
Look about last night --
-- It's Malone's.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Wash her.
-- White ladies?
-- please, please forgive me...
-- why did you come in today?
-- how did you get here?
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Hi, George.
Where?
George --
We live together now.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Go where?
George.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Didn't you, baby?
What do you wanna know for?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- please, baby --
I wish you'd go now.
Please!... that's not like you.
What did you say?
In a way. But...
It's good you want to do something, George.
They're not?
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
You live like a pig.
What do they look like?...
Now wait a minute...
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about her?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
What?
No.
Come on by.
What do you mean?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Don't be silly.
You're really a love -- you sure?
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Why don't you ask for another one?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Johnny!
That bastard.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You're kidding.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Dad?
Yes?
Yes.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Room 237?
Jack...
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Oh,
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
Yes?
Not for me.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Royalty?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Fine.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Well... was it a prescription?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
Were you tempted?
SING!
What did who say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Hold on.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
It'll be hell.
Is there any syrup?
A cigarette?
A novice.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Mary Clarence!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Mary Clarence!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
It has come to pass.
What?
And all those like you.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
No food?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
My what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I got it.
In English?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
What are you doing here?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Really?  Lieutenant?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
How?
Oh-huh.
Where's who?
Not... totally.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
There she is!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Yes?
If we could speak alone.
Certainly not.
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring Young Masbath here.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I'm sure I don't know.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
What is it?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Why... why are you like this?
Lady Van Tassel...
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
People have put their trust in you.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I apologize if I worried you.
And, what did he say?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
You are from the Hollow?
She is guilty.
No.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
You have any biscuits for sale?
What do you like to eat here?
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Don't tell me what to do.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Childers.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
But maybe just for awhile --
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Naw.
It was alive?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
You will? For sure?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Did Karl go to bed?
You walk fast, don't you?
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
Yeah.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
No, we have to get this story.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Signs?
It's my birthday.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
What about for you?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Hey, man, good to see you.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Hey, man, how's it going?
You usually get two.
Anything good?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Every word.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
A little. Not much.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
You mean Rashid?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
And you told your nephew about it?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
What's your offer?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
What time is it?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Yeah, I picked it up.
That's it. In a nutshell.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Is that your third question?
Now, Mister Gi...
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
How long you have this detail?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
You always run with the well open?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You wouldn't even see it move.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
I believe so.
What else could it be?
The same.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Okay, doll.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
You're welcome.
What did he say?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
You going to call the police?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
With ME?
I am.
I'll say there is!
Like what?
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Isn't that ridiculous?
You all right?
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Josephine -
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Who?
Why not?
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Oh?
Because I got some plans -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Rough?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
Saxophone player?
My fault.
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Not at all.
Well, I'm not.
Up, up, up.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Tonight?
You collect shells?
Would you mind moving along, please?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
I don't want to bore you.
Talk about sad.
You poor, poor boy.
What else is there for me? 
What is it?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I know.  Every time!
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Hey.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Not for a dog.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Why?
You quitting?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
What?!
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Come on.
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
But nothing did.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
Sometime, but not like this.
Uh huh...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
And so you did your job, right?
What do that mean?
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Yes, sir...
You learnin' anything at that school?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
What's that, son?
Yes, David...
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
What is it, David Lee?
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
What's wrong, Nathan?
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Tired.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Little chilly.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Mom...
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
I don't know.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
What's the password?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
WHAT?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Huh?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
You know I do.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
My friend the clitoris told me.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Anna...
Evening.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Idiot...
Barnes?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
That's right.
I don't know what we're facing.
Explosive?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I'll do my best.
What the hell are you doing?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Will you marry me?
What is it?!
So I've been told.
Carlo!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
You're not from around here, are you?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
The pin machine?
Nope.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
No kiddin'.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
How Mr. Kastle?
After we eat, Dad.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
132, 154.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Where did your brother escape from?
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Come on, bargain with me.
What are you going to do about your brother?
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
He's dead Sheila.
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Get out of there!
There's heat coming the door.
Fifty yards and closing.
Where is it?
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
It's impossible.
Picked up something?  What is it?
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Wait a second --
What for?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
I see it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Norman!
Where'd this come from?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Yeah, why?
Beth --
What are they?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You said something to him, didn't you?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Still clear?
None of this was here before.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Squids?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
How can the sphere do that?
Sintag.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's like a sleeping pill?
How long does it last?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
You tell me.
Don't you?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
C'mon -- what?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Beth!
Beth --
No.  I don't think so.
What are you looking for?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Am I?
What noise?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
The three of us.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Nine hundred feet to surface.
You mean forget?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Does this mean what I think it means?
The ships?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
What report?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean a picture?
This is like nursery school.
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Four.  Four years --
Was it a military crash?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Here come six more... grid two!
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Profile's wrong... there.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Where are you going ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
It stinks, you goin.
Hey, Diz...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
The Creator has not answered.
Departure angle on viewer.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Well, it had sentimental value.
Why did you quit?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You'd know better'n me.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>How</u>...?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Thank you.
Read the card.
The other side.
Why?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
What's the scene...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
What?
You know what else a man can do?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...and we could get up every morning...

He didn't have to tell...

Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
The girl was in the car.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...not at all...
...it is?
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.

Are you <u>real</u> mad?
Rachel's job is she works.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
That I do.  Always will.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Rache says it's from you.

That's necessary, huh?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!

Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
They don't hate you --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
I think so...What do you think?
I told her I loved her.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Marty, ignore him.
Thank you.
Really? How many?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
What's an audience going to tell you?
We used pull.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Oh. What happens now?
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Who is this?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well get someone down there!
What do you think?
Cooper...
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Where does it lead?
Enjoying the tour so far?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
We can't--it's power driven!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Where is this...thing?
Yes?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
General Schmuck?
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I don't think so, sir.
I guess so.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
How long will it take to receive them all?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
General, stick to the point, please.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Check.
Roger.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
He's dead, all right.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
Recall what mistake?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Slides go with it.
Responsibility, progress.
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
No, no.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
She's dead?
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
No.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Oh, you were in the band?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Score! Yeah!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah, we're all above that.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Come on. Inside.
It's nice here. It's different.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Erica.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
What? What'd you do?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Why we're just standing here.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Look, why do you care, huh?
You could've come over.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Like what?
Of course I do!
Yeah.
New ground?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Where are you going?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, Pony.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Sorry.
Like songs?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Get off my roof!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yep.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Tim?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Hi, Artie.
Give me your coat.
That was the general idea.
This is Miss Kramer.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
As for instance?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
What teacher?
I was afraid of that.
What about all those ideas you had?
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
So do I.
Oh, you --
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
May I say you smell real special.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
I don't want it now.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Or shall I call my servant?
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.

Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Is that so!
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Why did she have to show up now?
Whatever you say.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Maybe it was just an accident.
What's happening?
When can I see, you again ?
You love me?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Let me kiss you.
No.
I sort of like what you said.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Wait. Don't leave me.
Before you go...
She's right. They'll string her up.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
They think I have a concussion.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
I've got things to do.
Yes.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
But what for?
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
What? Me?
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What is this place?
Shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
You look at them? How?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Too much mayonnaise?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
You...um...you never got married?
No, thanks.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Kent!
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
What are you doing?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Man, what is this?
When?
Hey, boss.
Turn on the T.V.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
We've already met.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
There's no rush.
But the bridge...
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Okay? Goodbye.
We already have a super-tanker.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
I don't?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Really?
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Gee. But --
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
Why?
Shhhhhhh!
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
I really don't think . . .
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Is he for real?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
What do you fear?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
He's thirty-five years old.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Mother...
Keep warm now.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
What'd you call him?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Nuts. He made it.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
Meteorites!
Ready?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Two.
It's a ...baby.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
He'll be weightless.
Twenty-four.
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
It must feel great.
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
She didn't.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Are you sure?
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Billy, that's too early.
Your kids never cry.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
That would complicate things.
Anything you didn't understand?
I didn't say that.
Away from your crazy Mom.
And winter?
Oh.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
You seem very sure about that.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Some more wine?
Excuse me?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You saw the speedometer?
No.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Yes.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
There's talk of that.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
No...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Can I come in for a minute?
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
What does that mean - integrity?
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
You're incapable of the truth...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
But what?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Everything.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
I'm sorry, John.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I have detailed files.
Is it safe for them here?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
What's that mean?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Not yet.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I was warned.
What did Goering say?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
What telegram?
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
No!
What?
I don't understand what you mean.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Yes, you remember.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Alright!
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
Reese...you got a first name?
Bag some Z's?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
What's that?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
Why?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Give me the short version.
Call her.
The stock will turn.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
Why not?
I'll wait.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
That's classic.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Well... the red bra.
Do you mind if I sit?
Want anything to drink?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
We searched the house.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Shut up!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
One brother, one sister.
Hey there, Nickie.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
No.
I'll call them, okay?
How do you mean, exactly?
Stop this.  It's not true...
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
The key?
You did?  How is he?
What makes you ask?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
His behavior... ?
No.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
He hasn't called back.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
I only saw Theo drive up.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Nell --
Nell!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Like she smelled it too?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Are you coming to confess?
Someone is playing with you.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
This is where we're going?
Get a blanket!
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
She needs help.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Who?
Why?
Fifteen dollars.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
David.
That's so sad.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's not a knock.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Why not?
How they goin', kid?
Oh really?  Where you from?
Huh?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
No one else is even here yet.
Weren't you on a television series?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Not embarrassed.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
What line is he in.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
What'd your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Yeah, I guess you are.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Sounds like you need a rest.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
How much.
Hey.
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
You bet.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Is Valentine here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Who's looking for you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Ah.
Tell me.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Geez, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uh-huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
Birdy--
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Yeah.
It's OK.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...Huh?
Honey...
Honey...
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
...Did you make that up?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Uh-huh.
Whuddya mean?
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Uh-huh.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
I don't understand.
...You're Ed Crane?
He's a barber.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Sweet Jesus!
Do they have to wear uniforms?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened to them?
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
I don't believe it.
I'm not giving up.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
We will.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Quiet!
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Stop!
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
What do you make of it, Margo?
Eats them?
And John?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
What was it?
You're not.  Where is it?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
We're not going to make the storage room!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Where exactly?
<i>A month.</i>
I thought you were in a hurry.
What music?
Welcome.
Amnesia.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Lauren, right?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Your Dad?!
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Oh, God.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
How are you, Mother?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It looks so small.
The whole area's being evacuated.
I don't understand.
How's it going, Truman?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Special Agent Scully --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
And if it's unsuccessful?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
You told me you had answers.
You're looking for a bomb.
I think they have that covered.
Now what?
I was until about an hour ago.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
This virus -- it... 
This is weird, Mulder.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I need you on this, Scully --
What? What happened?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I can't go any farther.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
What alien environment?
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Sing a song of sixpence...
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
I realize that...
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
You're sure of that?
Yep.  Eloped.
They're hungry.
You liked him?
I need you to find something in the basement...
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
No.
Do you understand German?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
He has a little dog.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
They're forged.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
H-E-Z-T...
I thought you wanted...
Let's go away.
What happened to your hand?
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Oh, the usual things...
His.
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Must you take those?
...to him.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Well?...
I suppose you don't believe me.
You do!
Welcome?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
As long as they can use you?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Vinkel.
Yes.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Nice work.
Big?
I'm sorry.
But he has been there, off course.
Hi.
We swim.
No.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Fucking Danny, man...
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You're not in school? What do you do?
Oh, really?
Where'd you get this?
I want to learn to read it.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Why should I submit?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
No. What are you looking for?
That's a much easier game.
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
How would you kill him?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Are all Jews the same?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Who killed Manzetti?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Steve...
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
You could do it.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Where?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
What are you trying to say?
You can't say that....
Who's this?
Howard Stern.
Fund-raising??
Are you out of your mind?!
Eat shit....
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
But your man isn't quite a God!
You're leaving?
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Is it a poem?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
He can learn.  He is learning.
How do you know that?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Yes?
What about the shoes?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Well, what are they?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
No, no!
Enzo?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Can I come in?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Jacques...?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
What?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
How was your trip?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Please. Will you help me?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
So. Do you have a name?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
What should I charge?
You really think so, Charlie?
What do you want to see him for?
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Who?
Don't look at it!
Oh, that's so interesting!
It's about the leopard.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Come to look around?
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Not! I tell you. No!
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
You're too good to me.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Must it?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Excuse me?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
When did you get back?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I know where to look.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
What...?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Then find another way.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I see. How much?
On the bed!
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Trying to say something, Martin?
Yeah.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Excuse me?
Alors?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Gluck.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Try again, and this time be polite.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
What did they say?
The king said you're his finest archer...?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't know...
To avoid killing anyone.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Yes...
Thanks be to God.
Buying her?
You did well...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Is it long and hanging down?
Go on to the next question.
5,000 gold crowns.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yeah...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
What have you done to me?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Do you think this cross will protect you?
"Love your enemies"...
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes, my lord.
I don't want to wait for his call.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Wladek, please.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I need help.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
For what? For my tie?
What's happened?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That's better than yesterday.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Yes, so did the Germans.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
Sorry, I don't remember.
No, it was a table.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
She looks tired.
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
The piano.
You'd have to organise it up here.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You're late.  Where you been?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
You know anything about him?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
I never played for winos.
Henry.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Looks like he missed ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
I'm in.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
How are you?
Well!
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Did he tell you where he was going?
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
She fell down.
I don't know.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
It's a promise?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Nothing.
I'm asking you.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What about Jorgensen?
I think we're on the right track.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
What're you doing here?
Shut up.
No.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
You've said that for weeks.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
We're just having a little drink.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
What did you do with the rest?
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
No.
How are you?
It might.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
You did... where?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
What are you going to do with it?
That's jolly.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Back to California
What do you mean?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Huh?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
You're going to drive me crazy!
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
They stopped.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
No.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Just keep quiet.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Blow me.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
SAY IT!
What!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
It's a fire fight.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
He's not going to leave us.
Wes might be right about that.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Slip out your M-16.
And then shoot them.
What do you make of them?
Somebody has to.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
People are suffering.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Naw, nothing.
Jaeger?
That's in two days.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Oh, Jesus!
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
You have to go with us, Wes.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
So?
You're going to burn up in those.
Stress category.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
You know I don't feel well.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
You don't know.  You don't....
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
no...no, no.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Where's LUH?
I'll report you.  It's....
How do you know?
What kind of answer is that?
What was that....
Where's LUH?
They're not here.
Go ahead.
Where did you get this?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
So what were they doing here?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
This is where the van was parked.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
It's working.
What's up?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
More metal... sharp edge...
I don't know.
Right.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Jesus...
No... No more killing.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What the hell's going on?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
Goddamit, Reilly--
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Yes!
Good morning, Major.
Just dull.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
You say I am a crook.
Who?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Disappointed?
Thank you, Baron.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Spanish passports?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
I remember.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Eighteenth century.
Beautiful.
Precisely.
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I <u>must</u> go.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
You look beautiful.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Yes--uh--
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I beg your pardon!
Yes, my bag!
How much time?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
What?
None of the stewards have seen her.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Is this in any way unclear?
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I know what ice fishing is!
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I don't know the steps.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Will you pardon me?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
So you washed it off!
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Brett is the name.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
How well do you know her?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
We coulda got two third-class!
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
What is it?
On the drunk.
Come in! 
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
How about you?
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Next month is June.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I didn't--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
I was in his cabin--
Isn't that a daisy?
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Yes, very.  And very married.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
How you feelin', Doc?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Colorado's closer
Praise Jesus!
Fun though, wasn't it?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Yeah?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
That a fact?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
They're carrying guns in town.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Briefly.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
- Four wheel drive?
Yes -
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Shhhhh...
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Gone fishing.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
... Does this do anything?
Happily.
Thanks.  Take care -
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
If I were you -
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
No.
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
What the hell is going on?
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You must have been really sick.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Good morning.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
None of your business.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
What are you doing?
How are you?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Yeah?!
Hey!  Wow!
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
That's why.  Sid.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Don't tell me what to do!
Hold on, Woody!
Ha-ha!!
Hi!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Laser-envy.
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
I got it, Woody!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
You'll put your clothes here.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I did like the music.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
You're not so old yourself!
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Finn ...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I'm Melanie.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Helena --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Do you work?
Private?
What's that mean?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
What do you think it is?
Depends on the state.
Not Tiger Woods.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
What's he doing up here?
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
But will he be house-trained?
It could mean that, yes.
It's possible.
My work keeps me young.
Any idea how much?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
She hasn't called you?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What's your name?
What?
Diane.
Yes.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Cheers.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Did he -- you know?
What?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Sounds great, Swanney.
There.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
It could. Yes.
The ship....
Rescued at last.
Plotting our new course.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
I don't understand.
Jim.
Yes, Captain.
I cannot be certain.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
I believe I have found a faster way.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
We must change our course at once.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.

I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I belong here.
Want one?
Did he say why?
You call that getting over it?
I'm sorry -
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
Alan!
Well, isn't it -- ?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
But-what if I can't...?
My quarters.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Dad, how come you know the words?
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
What's the plan?
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
I thought this look like your work.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Hello?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
The letter I sent.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Tell me about yourself.
What do you want to know?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Very much. Now, where were we?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Do you get paid a lot?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Is he black?
I don't believe so.
I do.
Where you goin', honey?
What?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Was it him or you?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
What?
What?
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
I'm her husband.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What's to think about?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Yeah?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
We grew up together.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
You were a cop.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Uh-huh.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
He'll wear a wire?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Nicholson and I.
You do.
Rock whores.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Just put it in your purse.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
So that...???
A jail?  Prison?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
1995?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
No more drugs.  Please...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't know -- I don't remember.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
You want something, old man?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
More or less.
Any parting words of wisdom?
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
How much.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What you want?
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
It is morning.
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
What do you want?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
It's Grace.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Least you can leave.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
What happens if you lose?
Did you like it; me watching you?
My face tell you all that?
Like you.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah.
Take me with you.
I can't.
Jake.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
You live pretty good.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I wanted to talk.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
Where's the safe?
There has to be!
Let's do it here.
To get my car.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
John!
Are you all right?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
John Stewart.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I asked you a question.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Oz.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
The old lady?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Christ no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
California...
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Come on, Jake --
But you was going to fight for me.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
No! Okay! Okay!
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
I want my car.
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Thank you, Bobby.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Nice place.
Are there snakes out here?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
There is no us, remember?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Anywhere?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Why's that?
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Out of here.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Genuine Draft?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Grace.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
When was the last time I wore pink?
Megan?
I remember you.
Rust?
What about the game?
Why?
You've never been sick?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
I want to sleep here tonight.
I'll just shoot him once.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Yeah, I guess.
Alive?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But he was called...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
What'd Ned say?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Well, how about it?
Jesus!
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
That was... the first one.
You could have it. All of it.
You ain't shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Beats the hell out of me.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Tom?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Far enough.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
I don't kill nobody without him. 
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
An' if I spot 'em?
Jack. What are you doing here?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
I don't get it.
They want more time to think about investing.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
This is not right.
Then who goes?
He's alright.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
How are you, Keaton?
with what?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Who is he?
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I know he was good.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
This is totally irrelevant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Edie...
This is all bullshit.
You're not safe on your own.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
What did he find?
Very good.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
We thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
It looks that way.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
I'm on the staff of...
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
No.
They lied.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
The Doctors were not negligent.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
Dr. Gruber ...
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
I object, your Honor...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
... now who is that ...?
I'm going to help her.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
I'm swell.
...one of the other nurses?
...four years ago...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
She did?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
One hour.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
And when she goes to those places...
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
You're not far wrong.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Judy Barton.
Then will you for me?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Can I see you tomorrow?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Will you, Judy?
You want me to dress like her?
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
The color of your hair...
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
We're going up the tower.
Yes!
No...
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
You've nothing to apologize for.
-- talking to you...
Meet again, sometime.
I don't know.
How can you be sure?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Here with you.
Take me away from here?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
A grave...
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
No.
Yes --
Yes?! But --
Madeleine --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
What's tomorrow?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
Uh-huh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
That!?!
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Did you need it?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
She's fucking hot!
You're an asshole Adam.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Go home!
What?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We've already done this.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I am not flexible on this.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
If anything ever happens to me...
What?
I don't think so Boyd.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Nobody knows she's here.
I'm talking about prayer.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
He is not cracking up.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Regarding what?
My what?
You hate women.
You have a King fantasy.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
There's my point exactly.
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Photographer?
Sent it.
Yup.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Who else?
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
We've got problems here.
What kind of seats can we have?
You go down there.
Of course.
I love you.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Okay.
Well, can you come back inside?
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
Micheal, by accident.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
Like how?
No...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
What is it?
No...No.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
A move?
My God...
You alright?
What song?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
The post-Vegas Man.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Don Amalio!
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
How in hell does it wind up?
What do you know about me?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Yes. Why?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Where?
Yes -- very, very big!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
You all right?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
You think he's smart?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
He hears...everything.
HEY!!!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
It was me, what?
My God...
SID —— NO!!!
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Which way?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
I don't think you're gonna need it.
Mr. President, this is St...
...The Albanian Campaign...
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
The American "people"?
Why?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
<u>Who</u>?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.
We'll be back tonight.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Knock on wood.
...brazen-it-through...
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Courage, Mom.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
I have a question for you.
I'll play your silly game.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Dartmouth
When's he coming back...?
Trade Re1ations.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
"Freedom."
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
The War ain't over. 
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What?
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
Get on your feet, boy.
No, I'm On Top of it...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Show Must Go On.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
They look stupid.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
The hats.
With their berets...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
...mmm.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Please, no thanks... 
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
...Work okay?
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Your words, not mine...
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
So you're hot on this stock?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
So what's the problem?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
...Gordon.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
What if I have a previous engagement?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
I can't...and I won't.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
That's not what you said last night.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
That was very good.
That's not true.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Did you?
I didn't want to come.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Who's that?
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I wanted to apologize.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
You must think I'm pathetic.
She never mentioned her father.
Well good.  So you're human.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Then what was it?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I guess not.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
If you have to work...
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Why?
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
In the house.  I was scared.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Where is she then?
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
When you do this, I swear...
You're not at the center.
I never said...
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Claire--
Claire, please don't...
I never asked you to quit!
We have to get out of here.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Who is this...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Eighty million doll --- ?
Better than most, I suppose.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
There is no one here but the dead.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
Harder...
What else did you see- Michael...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Rowan...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Wanna snack...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
I can't.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
Sounds good - thank you
When could I look round?
I don't know
You don't know?
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
It's been what, three years?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
From your lips, to God's ears.
And I was wondering.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Watch your tone, mister.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Well?
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
My new bike.
Very funny.
It's not up to me.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
That's a crappy thing to say.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
In what sense?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I don't get the distinction.
I guess.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
You're amazing.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He's on the move?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Come on.
Maybe someday.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
You called the cops on us?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
How soon can we get something?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
I understand.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Why?
You didn't cuff her?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Ms. Toller?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Hi, Sandy.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Prepare what?
That's a lot of butler.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
What?  President Grant is...!
It was in your book.
My hat is off to you, sir.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He's not giving up?
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Really?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
You've... done... this... before.
Private train?
French?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
You're not that big.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Easy now.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You are very important, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Did she ask about me?
She's in love.
What do you want!
How am I gonna do that?
Ouch!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
She's hungry.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Talk!  Say something!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
I thought I was the English.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Are they going to kill you?
Are you really ever coming back?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
What was that?
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Oh? Anything else?
What?
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Your husband's?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Sure.
I was being foolish?
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Johnny, what the fuck?
You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Wrong.
Did you find him?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
You didn't have to...
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
I don't believe you!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
This?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh -- 
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
We might.
Dorothy!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...yes.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Yeah.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
What happened?
Where -- where do we go now?
Not even a rhinoceros?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
That's right.
To Oz?
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
What about us?
What happened to Len Tashka?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Nuclear.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
I’m sorry.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
What is it?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
So you killed your father.
Valentin Zukovsky.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
I’ll send someone out.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He was a...good lover?
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
Would you like me to stay?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
What -- am I --
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
. . . What?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
What?
So do I.  So do you.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
What happened?
What caused it?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No comment.
I don't know their real names.
I'm terribly sorry.
Am I free to go?
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
What do you have?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
Whatchu doing here?
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
What do you get if you finish?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
They tell me you're an American agent.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
You okay?
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Nothing. He had two days.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Alright, so I'll get more.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Why you dogging me up?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Into the Hudson?
Jean... can you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Were you now?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
The intention of registration act -
What do you want?
What am I doing here?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
If she held on any longer she could have.
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
I'll find him.
The way what is going to be?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Oh, shit.
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Yes, sir.
You have your tickets?
Promise??
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
Darling!
Are you suggesting I call him master???
I suppose you're right.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
You mean... the laboratory??
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Why did you do that?
What?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Are you putting me on?
I see.
What wockers?
But what you were doing?
What is this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Hmm!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Why?
You'll be getting me sad next.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
And look at this, Doctor!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I see what you mean.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Four
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Drink!
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Yes?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
