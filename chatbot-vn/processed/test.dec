Forget it.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
What crap?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You set me up.
What if she never starts dating?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
Yeah -- we'll see.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Where?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Nope - just came by to chat
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
You didn't
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

I'm fine. I'm
Dorsey.
Then why'd you ask?
I'm gettin' there
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Pleasant?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Fallacy.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You know what I mean
No.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
I thought you were punishing me.
Funny.
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
What?
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
You don't usually ask.
I am busy inside.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
All of them created by people like me.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
You are bound by an oath, Father.
That she was impregnable.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We can't be.
You think I don't know that?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
No.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
No.  I'm okay.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Watch the news?
I don't even watch TV.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You got any better ideas?
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Raw deal.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Okay.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
You promise?
Keep them out of my way.
And what do you do with the bones?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Milos.  Get my money!
You've got a call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
The clerk?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Okay, come on down.
It's possible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Yes, Daddy.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Really?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true.
Opening pod bay doors.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You're crazy.
Bullshit.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
What are you talkin' about?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Come on.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I'll help you out.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What'd you do?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Shut up.
Shut up.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Naw, right here's okay.
Don't mess with me. How much?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
No thank you.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
That's what I thought.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
I would like to have died in peace...
So, just how big was this fare?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Where have I heard this song before?
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Oh, yes you will...
What is... Make Love?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Wait or act.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Snuff?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
I want to watch you work.
I'd rather you didn't.
Machine's in?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Who is this.
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah.
Because we're going there.
You got absolute zero.
Don't think I won't.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Shut up.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Fuck you.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Not quite.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You don't have any other choice.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
That's exactly what I am.
Are you religious?
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
I don't know.  I think so.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Who is this... ?
Her belongings?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
No, sir, he is not.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Save it for later.  Come on!
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
What?
Oh God!  He killed them!
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Now.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
So did Dan.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Anything ---
After torpedo room:  Report!
What?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
How soon?
Yeah.
Guaranteed, eh?
You might not kill it.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You know.
To us it was.
I don't want to.
It's not that.
No.
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Pop?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Don't go playing policeman.
You mean Twombley?
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I'm fine, fine.
On what you pay me?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
What way?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Call it what you want.
Who?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Then who shot him?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
That's not really the point.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Put your pilot on.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Stand by.
Thank you.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
No.
Hold on, Alice.
Twenty minutes?
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Other way around, sir.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Commissioner.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Yes I did...
Sir?
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Now!
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I think so.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
That's not possible.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
And a little ice!
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Yes?
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Every day.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Here?
Nice signal, dickwad!
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
In the other man's rectum.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Thank you.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Yes.  That follows.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Why not?
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Now, wait a second --
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Stand back.
Fuck you.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Did you ever have a baby?
That's right.
What are you talking about. What people?
What do you mean?
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Why not?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
I want to go!
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Fartsbishop!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Tell them to go!
Wolfi.
Why not? Half the house!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Madame. How can I help you?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
He needs me, ma'am.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Ah-ha!
And the result satisfies.
Oh?
Of course not.
Well, look at them.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
I think so, Sire, yes.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
What is it?
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
That's not what I hear.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Yes what?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down!
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
I can't say. Really
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Did my work please you?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Oh, yes.
What time?
I think so.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
A little modesty would suit you better.
Baron!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Should I?
You cannot say that!
I did.
You must be mad.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
I agree, Baron.
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
No, a cab will be faster.
Tea would be nice.
What?
How is that?
Aw come on, Alex!
Right.
Will you give me a break?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
My best friend. My very best friend.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
It's nice to see you.
Of course.
Don't you remember?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
No what?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
No, but we're about to.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Yes.
Did you see Jack?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Right.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Look at that.
Right.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
What was it?
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
Plan?
Where are we going?
Are you going to help me up?
What?!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Will you be quiet?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Stop it, Jack.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Why don't we ask him?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
No.
You here again? What do you want?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I haven't got it.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Good for you. Come on.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Now?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Yes, of course.
No.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes, sir.
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Hardly.
With what?
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
There you are!
I don't know.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Then I love it.
Two.
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Tell me.
I could use the walk.
You're not scared, are you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
It was exciting.
Yeah.
I got three.
Yep.
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
That's it.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
It's a secret.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
So we got a plan?
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
We're gonna have to talk...
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
How much of that story is true?
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Sparkling rocks?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
But I like the presidential suite.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I'm not hanged yet.
Fair enough.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
And the same age Web was. No.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
We did.
Sir?
What, sir?
It is a nice piece of writing.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
It's going to be a long spring.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Courtney? Dinner?
Dorsia's nice.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Pull out.
Turn the light on.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
I never knew you smoked.
You just haven't been looking.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Is your Evian spiked?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
You saw the ad in the Times?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
No, you...didn't?
Where are you going?
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
See you then.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Dorsia is...fine.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's...that's too bad.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Understandable.  Lime?
Your address?
Thanks.
No problem. 
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Nothing.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Al.
I've been great. And you?
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
So you believe me?
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
I am. I am, sir.
What?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Oh. No thanks.
Skywire.
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
Oh. Yeah.
The wrong place?
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Got out of my other commitment.
You know my name.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
But why would they --?
He's out of prison?
Hmm?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Gary.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Did you tell Alice?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
To my health.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Excuse me?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Thanks.
Yes Basil?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Why not? It's a question.
My mother's told me all about you.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
A Chigro?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
How do you know?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Of course, luv.
Who?
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Are you crazy?
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Yes.
Yes.  Scott!
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Why?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Red ...
... head ...
Sir August...?  What now?
Impossible?
This isn't a game.
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
Next assignment?
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Any ideas?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Always.  Except ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
You lied.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Global warming?
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Mother and Father know best.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Keep me informed.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
What are we having?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
About what?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Great, Mom.
Quiet, Mother.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
What's going on?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I'll take some.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Ha, ha, ha.
It's Bullwinkle.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
The best table in the house.
Oooooo.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Who?
Right... Think it over.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Yeah...
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
Stevie... I...
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
What, you've never seen one before?
Hey! You don't know me --
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Fuck you.
So hello.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
You're back.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
When I was twenty.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Well, you did invite me here.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I was doing my job.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
I want another shot, Sir.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What are you listening to?
I don't guess.
Yeah.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Swayzak's not my boss.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Management were pin heads.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I treated you better.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
What's to believe?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Yes.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Yeah. I'm sure.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
B-L-A-K it is.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Delacroix.
C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
Why are you smiling so?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Damn skippy.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
You're now Mantan.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
It's me, Peerless.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
You feel good, not nervous?
Same thing Giuliani said.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
I'll be right over.
Where is he?
Regardless, he still is your father.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
How be dat?
Maybe you need to start.
My people love me.
Stop playing me Sloan.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
I'll match any man with the sword.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
The coward!
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I have heard of them.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Yes, sir.
Then you yield to me.
That is a trifle strong.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Who?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
HEY!
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Okay.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
That son of a bitch.
You saw West's body.
Jesus!
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
There were six of us...
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Put it down!
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Mr. Hardy?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I didn't --
And the problem is you only got three.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
You made me look like an idiot --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
I lost a bet.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
The very same.
I lied. Wait for it...
Let's go talk to Bill...
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
So did I.
Get in.
Want company?
I should probably write that down.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
I don't think I want to hear this --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Wrong answer --
We're not going anywhere.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Who is she? Where does she live?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
No one's ever left.
Then do it.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Well, she... uh...
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I know.
Please?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Did you do any of that?
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
Yes.
Dad?
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You say...
There is no softer ground than town.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I wasn't expecting you.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
But it's romantic.
But it's not true.
How much time does he have left?
Of course.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
You know what for.
Such as?
I paid for those guitar cases.
The sets were good.
Yes.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Tell me what he said.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
What? What does he want?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Yes.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
I don't want to talk about him.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes.
So now you hate all women?
I wasn't saying anything.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Except for Small Eyes.
Goodbye.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Okay.
Well, that makes it easier.
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Let go...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Two days?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Nothin'.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Uh-huh.
Naw!
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yeah, I know.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
The hell you call me?
Nick, we can't just --
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
All right, how's the new partner?
If you give me one.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
There she is!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
I'll check it out.
I want to yank Kobo.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's illegal, Nick.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
So I bring some cheese?
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
There was a change in plans.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
This by this...
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
I'll pay you.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Death.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Like what?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
This afternoon.
He's not ready yet.
Yeah.
Soon as I finish the job.
Okay, but...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Longevity is classified.  No.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Shot of vodka, please.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Yeah?
But if you could?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
And who do I go to about you?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I think you need more help than you've got.
Can you?  I couldn't.
How are you doing?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Sitting next to you.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Sorry.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Beautiful.
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Really?
Do ya?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
It was amazing.
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
I think it's the eyes.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
What's the pay?
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Thank you.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Tempus fugit!
Like a painting?
Blow out the candles!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I'll try.
Yes, sir. It's true.
She's right?!
It's so small.
I don't think so.
I just don't want to.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
I LOVE THIS!!
What?
You don't look thirty-five.
Gladly.
Good!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Well, where are you --
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
No.
I'm not hungry.
Honey?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
We do?
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
Oh, yes.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
That's what I'm sensing.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
Uh, yes, you do.
He didn't leave with them.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
See my breasts? See?
Don't say that.
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Alright, suit yourself.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Can I feel 'em?
Good, let's drink up.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Maybe so.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Alright.
Let's go.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Okay.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
What did you do, Connor?
You sound real remorseful.
What are you saying?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Fuck!
Aye.
How many?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Three.
Rocco!
Where's my cat?
Male or female, bitch?!!
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Sicilians.
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
No way they could have seen it?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Twist of lemon!
Sweet-n-low!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
What are you serious?
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hey Murph.
No. You sure you're okay?
Well, I'm sold.
What the fuck do you mean?
Y-Yes my son.
Yes.
God have mercy on my soul.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
What does Starsky say?
No. This is he.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
There's another stocker, right?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I keep it for emergencies.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
No. We didn't.
What. What's the matter?
As long as he gets out OK.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Where was it parked?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Our money situation is not good.
Get out of the way.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
You got to be kidding me.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
How big is it?
He stole a tractor.
How?
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Are you afraid?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Why'd you want to help us?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Who's got the car keys?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Let's cut the bullshit.
It's true, Dignan.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
That's my responsibility.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
So it's my fault?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Jesus Christ.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Run. Run. Let's go.
This is no good.
Oh, yeah.
What can we do?
You got that?
No. I just have short hair.
Sure.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
It's locked.
Will it track back to us?
Never heard of it.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
No... It must have been Bourne.
Don't know.
Keep going...
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
I can't let you do that either.
Felt a little light.
I did.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
So...
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
What's that?
Who's going? Us?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
So he fooled you.
Alright...
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
Peace?!
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
He was a modest man.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Hamish, I... thank...
I rest.
That's just a dream, William!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
How many?
I should'a remembered the eggs.
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Let her speak.
I do not confess.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Tonight then.
And I with you. But you must wake.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
...I wouldn't know.
It's battle I want, not talk.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I must... consult with my father.
They've tricked us.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What?
But you must have something to go on?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
So you believe me?
Yes.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I don't get it.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
We'll find out soon enough.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Yes, Monsieur.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Yes, Monsieur.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I'm awfully sorry.
That's all right.
It's not for sale.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Please.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Does he always leave so early?
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
Ask me?
Sam?
Not at all.
Yes, I get the point.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
Here it is.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
Goodnight.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
And that is?
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
Huh!
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
He'll take one.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
That is my least vulnerable spot.
You think of everything, don't you?
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Take your hands off me!
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
No.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Not right now.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Just a little something of my own.
No, I don't.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Feels so good to lie here.
Do too little you'll die.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Moon's too bright.
Yeah, sure, what?
They're on autopilot.
There was an unavoidable delay.
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I can't take him to work.
I thought you might have.
If I'd known you were alive --
You have any children?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Not to mention on me.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Mom, meet Jango.
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
It was fifteen minutes late.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
San Francisco.  And you?
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Two.
Where's Mandalay?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
You don't understand! It's her father...
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
"...did." Well, okay.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, they aren't.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
No. She was an immigrant.
I don't remember.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
I guess so...
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Yes, for both.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Sorry, Homer...
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Ten percent. Of how much?
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
I was doing it for them.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Mob?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Come on...
Well, this is just fucking great...
I guess it lacks a certain style.
I can't do that.
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
No. Just confidence.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Says who?
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Good point.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
And we got rid of the red head.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Then who's the Banker?
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
I try.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
I'm down!
I'll take you up on that.
It's the tension.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Looking forward!
South African women are very sporty.
Not particularly.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I want to hear it.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you drunk?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
It will.
Then what?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
It's not that.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Well, thank you anyway.
Impossible to calculate.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Absolutely not.
You don't like cheats, do you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Wait a minute...
What for?
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
And the girls?
No thanks.
I don't gamble.
I'll tell you later.
I was at Beadles.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Five.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Fuck that shit.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Thanks.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Out where?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Talk to the bomb.
I'm on a break.
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I don't get involved with guns.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
No...
Mommy, where are you?
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Bent?
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Hardly...
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Open it.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
A friend of your fiance's.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Got a pencil?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
A little what?
How long you and me known each other?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
What if he's on the level?
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Max--
What happens if you level with her?
Easy Sketchy.
True, but--
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
Yeah.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Check!
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Curly.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Did you know him?
Donnie.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Not until like... eighth grade.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
What did you say?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
You mean soap?
Where are we going?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Infant Memory Generators.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Follow him where?
How are things going at school?
Can anyone else see him?
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
Yes. I went to jail.
When will this happen?
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
Kitty...
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's alive, sweetie.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
You-betcha.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
I'll be right back. See ya later.
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Enid ate a whole pan!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
And everything.  He should be king!
The President of the United States.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Well - what is he now?
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!! 
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
For you, I would do anything... 
No, I think a whiskey.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
Everything will be seen to.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
I don't understand.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Are you comfortable here?
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
What a mess.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
You've never been?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Your mother?
Good morning.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
Yes.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Yes. John wants it.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
Those things in your hands.
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
The second note to wake the Gods...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
A lot of people like our singing.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Sh!
About raping me?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why... should YOU care?
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
She got me thinking...
Look out!
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
What's the matter with Bjorn?
Bye... sorry...
Please.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Not now, Sven...
Sh!
I hate you! I hate you!
Me too.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
I like to read.
Very much.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Yeah, I guess.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Yeah.
No.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
No.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Yeah.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Hey, Joel --
I'm nervous, too.
Says you were a bully...
Doesn't sound like me.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Sorry. I just --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yes?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Is that Nietzsche?
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Jesus.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Easy come, easy go.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
What is Debbie's position?
Like what?
Well.... er...
I'm the best.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I heard it.
Justin?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
The containment, Second Containment...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
No, he didn't.
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It gets worse.
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
Please... kill...
Thank you.
The dark inside me.
Justin. I won't let you die.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
...you okay?
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Starck...
We have a situation here...
Understood.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Not according to the computer.
Do you know what it was?
Claire is your wife?
I'm alright. Please.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I'm worried about you.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
You'd never know it.
Youthful high spirits.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
You've been working out.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
And that's a good thing?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
I was talking about us. Working together.
That's good. That's uh... good.
If it happened to him, then it could...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You were?
Sure.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Skeptical...?
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
On the ledge?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
I don't know.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
No. It's too soon.
I would. Yeah.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Yes.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
I've been swimming, Merv.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
So what did you do?
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Hey! That's my line!
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Climax together.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
He's not coming.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
What's that?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
No. I mean back to your home.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
No. That's okay.
What about the notes?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Anything to drink?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naw!
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
He told me he was turning in early...
What limes?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Me?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Right.
They'll be back.
Nah, I got the gun.
Anyone.
Upstairs.
Come on, come on.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the head?
Well, justice is funny.
Oh yeah?
We lived near power lines.
We gotta try.
Why not then?
The girl's got rhythm.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
Wait God-dammit!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'd love to.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Are you lying to me?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Excuse me, sir?
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Who's this?
Thank you --
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm not!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
What?
Thank you.
Come here. I want to show you something.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
I know, but --
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
What night?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
...Don't you?
...I see.
Thank you, Harry.
But I'll never win that.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Is Kaminski a Communist?
I know that, Dad, but --
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Daddy!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
I wouldn't miss it.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why?
You sound as if you hate it.
What is this?
Why, you... you little bastard!
Don't touch me.
Yeah, well --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
You don't know what you want.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Harry... I met someone.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
To quarter-horses.
Oh Harry...
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
No, we're not.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Yes, Ma.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I don't care.
Not long.
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
I will, I promise.
I don't believe so.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Really? Any problems?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
'Incurable.'
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
I see it before me.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Her body pleases me.
I will not! Kill me now!
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
She's not for you.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
Quite right!
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Oh God.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
They'll hang him all the same.
For what?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
I have no knowledge of that.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Madness?
Who are you?
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Tomorrow is another day.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Thanks, Alice.
You okay?
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Girls can't be cowboys.
That's thirty percent.
For two lonely nights.
Sure.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Have you ever been there before?
So do I just follow you?
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
In other words, no.
It's a flop house.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Sure.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yeah, we got a bible.
-- you got your sink --
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I wasn't scratching!
You believe me don't cha?
Gotcha!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Didya look at the border?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
What do you mean?
Where are you?
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
No problem, lieutenant.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
I'll act surprised.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Sounds familiar.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
No, ma'am.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'd sure like to know who.
Yeah.  Me too.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Which is guy-speak for...
I think you look beautiful.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Mighta been civilian.
Maybe half.  Not even.
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
So am I.
I take it this file is still open.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
But we can get to the west side faster.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
What else do you know about it?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
What's it to you?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
It's Tatopoulos.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
I need you to trust me.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Leadership....
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Oh can't I? Watch me!
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Okay, now. But-
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
There is no weather in space.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
OK!
Right.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Don't be ridiculous.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
And determination.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
Then use rocks!
To learn to shoot cannon?
Who's in command out there?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
How can you say that?
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Let's get you darker!
They can use their imaginations.
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Yayo. Where is he?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Tell you what...
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Look at me, Ray.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Get in line, bro.
What've you got?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
Not really.
What does that mean?
Really? You ever been arrested?
He drown?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
He died.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
What're you doing here?
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
What do you get out of it?
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
You don't act like it?
I don't hear anything.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Maybe he isn't alone.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I think you better see this for yourself.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Because of the gold.
No.
What guy?
You sure it wasn't me?
You just shoot at something?
February first.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Just lucky I guess.
Epps, over.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
You don't remember?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Shut up.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Someone from the past.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Yeah, I heard about that.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
I...
Help me what?
You can count on me, sir!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
I figured something like that...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
I guess.
How long have you been up?
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I've been looking all over for this.
There's my dad with Joanie.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I can't believe it!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Somewhere downtown.
Should we leave a note?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
You won't believe it! Guess!
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Go ahead...
You're insane.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
What are you talking about? Who?
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Nothing.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
That's not even --
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Shh!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Are you okay?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
So, what happened?
What? You're kidding me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Well when can we do something?
Does that mean you don't like me?
Can you at least let me in?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
No problem.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Am I to take it you want to live?
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Don't they, though?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Have you got that in writing? 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
That's what the books say... 
What did I do?
We need to talk.
Somehow I guessed. 
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
I'll have to.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
Nonsense.
Do you love her?
Help finish the railroad.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Everybody has a choice.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Okay, let's take a look.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Good-bye, Peter.
I don't know what to do anymore.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
I'm not even good for me.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
You're right.  We should stay.

My pleasure.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
What kind of tests?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
I hate Jello.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
You finished here?
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Uuuuuuugh!!
I am Zuul.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Like a used car salesman.
Is he dying or something?
Talk to my accountant. 
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
We'll get back to you.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
In the physical sense.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What is it?
You could say that.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
See!  They are using drugs.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Don't cross the beams.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Oh, shit!
You talked to Gozer?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
LATER, MAN!!
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Yes?  Go on!
I want that bastard dead!
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Until your confirmation date.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Take grain away from the army?
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Of course...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I don't want you to die!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
That's one way to look at it.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
No.
Why not?
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But could you try?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Oh my God --
-- really incredible --
Did you say rape her?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
I don't know.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But you might.
I have to go back now.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
What?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
The Singleman party, sir?
A single room or a double room?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
That's right.
Will you take me home?
What?
I don't know.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Jesus Christ!
Let me out!
Very well. Thank you.
What?
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Yes.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Neither.
I don't remember.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Are you shocked?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Why are you asking me all this?
Really. I want to know.
Good.
I have my reasons.
You're not.
Did I say that?
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You wouldn't.
But it's not.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
I don't think so.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
You believe me, don't you?
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I do.
Well --
Have you thought about graduate school?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Oh no.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
But why?
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
They are?  Come on.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
With the pearls?
You can't.
How?
I have an idea working in my head... 
That.
Too bad.
Free --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Sorry.
Anything for you.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
And then --?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Just for a minute then.
You are beautiful!
No.
No?
That's a silly joke.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I must have made a mistake.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
I don't know.
Telegrams?
Anyone asked for me?
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Oh, don't go.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Moreover --
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Me.
I understand you perfectly.
It's urgent.
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're sweet.
Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Exactly.
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
My son was in the hospital --
You expect me to buy this?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Roy? He's always crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Henry, no!
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
What? He's going to be all right!
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
But they must be! They cut glass!
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Just myself.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
This way's perfect.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
That's right.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
We'll work something out, Joe.
I am in school.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
I want to know everything about you.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You already went back to work.
Working the what?
I'm a salesman.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Oh, come here.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
I don't think I need it.
Maybe I like it where I am.
What?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Care to join me?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Doesn't look good.
What the fuck are you talking about?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Nothing's missing?
My office?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I thought you'd never ask.
Nothing.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Just forget it...
No.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Please, get on the bus...
Why not?
I can see that.  Why?
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Okay... thank you.
Still wants to move out?
Bye Will.
What?
The serial killer?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I have to pee.
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
The voice man!  He's here!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
God ... this can't be true.
Him.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Halloween.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Um.
Must have changed that law.
At least we found the diamonds.
Tell them yourself!
How short the skirts are.
Go home!
The educational process.
You know me, boy.
Really?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Is Penelope in?
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Our pleasure.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Pass the fucking catsup.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
You're making a joke.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
What?
For Africa.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Sir?
Is anybody besides you here now?
They were in the same creative writing class.
England?
Oh hell.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
I don't know.
No, no, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Damn.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Dad--
What do you do for a living?
Situation.
We all are.
I did?
It's so--so stark.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
What a honeymoon.
People don't use that word any more.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Why not?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Stop!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Oh dear.
She's fine.  Please--
None.
Correct.
We'll find out now, won't we?
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
Don Quixote.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
She did?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
A what kind of doctor?
Still lives with his mother.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
What?
He isn't any friend of Father.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
The park!
How nice.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
That's the XKE.
The what?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Is that a fact?
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
But is she, has...
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
Pull out your cock.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
No. I saw her with Tod.
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Say what?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
What do you care about?
Tijuana.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They are the same.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What makes you so sure?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
And better?
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
What's it called?
Get out.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Like what?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
I don't know.
No.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
It's an investment.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
What do you think of that? Or this?
You ever play Chicken?
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
Who's that?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Harold Chasen.
It's very interesting.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What do you mean?
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
It is kind of rough.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
I like you, Maude.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With Life.
Oh.
But they have.
Well, don't go.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Fifteen.
Huh?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Why?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
To pit your own life against another.
The moment of truth.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
We've always been here.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
She certainly has.
What's the matter with her?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Because I'm going to get my father!
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
You were ALL human!
Steve...
Oh, excuse me...
We don't take hints.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Oh, right --
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Who wards off demons.
Is it bad?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
His what??!!
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Goodbye.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
You're going alone?
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
I have to speak to my father.
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
You remember.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
Poor baby.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Sure you are.
Frank.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
You're hurting.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
Yes. They'll never find us.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
So what's the argument?
In here.
We'll move in Sunday.
Larry....
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
Maybe I will.
I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
Surprise.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Of course.
Just upstairs.
Your father told me you were working here.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Not the point.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
Laura.  Her dad died.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
NO--!
Nobody.
He's not worth it!
Where's Rob?
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
What's his name?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Yeah, sure...
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
I'll tape it for you.
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Think about it, Rob.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
And do you like it that way?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Great... That's great.
Nothing.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Mmm hmm.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
What do you want to do?
It'll have to be sex, then.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Mission accomplished.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
No, but...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Harder.
You're being stupid.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
It's a crematorium.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
It's a great song.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
So you'll stay?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
And after that?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
We're not there yet, Justin.
I'm Vince.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Happy birthday.
Why?
No.
Carl Smith.
-Okay okay.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Where?
Dupont Circle.
That bothers you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're a fool.
I wish I could.
Yes.
I hope I never get that old.
You won't.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
I'd like you to try.
You killed those other two.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Will I see you again?
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
The inheritance.
Not power.  Not control.
Now there's a new topic.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
It's that important?
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
Why?
What are you doing man?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I don't know why.
I'm twenty-two.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Go to hell.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
No doubt.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We need more time.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Kahn?
Sit.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
You were never a kid.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Leave her alone.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
We were very close.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
The poem?... The poem was great!
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
The Criminal Courts Building.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Out some place.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Thanks a lot.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Ts! Ts! Ts!
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
The power of the press, huh!
Out of the mouths of babes.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
You can break it, can't you?
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What do you mean by that?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Where'd you meet this man?
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Thanks.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
How much do you want on it?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Was she? Did you notice?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Don't tell me you were worried!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
What's that -- what's that?
You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
What is it?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I never saw him before!
I was just going to!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
My name is Louis Peluso.
Who is it?
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
And up a dime.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Come on with that money!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
The what?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Pinkus.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
They're not.
Sod.
Would.
Who with?
Pauline.
It's not the same.
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Propaganda. We've been had.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
And the bride.
What's that?
Just ignore her, Mac.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
No, I won't.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
How are we going to cope?
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Father, that's enough now
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
That's not something to joke about.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
You mean John Wayne?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I don't.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Perfect.
Hell yeah.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
That seems likely.
Yeah?
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Sleeping.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Recover any bodies?
I don't doubt that.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Huh?
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Right...  ...come on.
Oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Not at all.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
That would be good.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
No. You look so beautiful.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
You still in the market for a real boy?
What do you mean?
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, darling.
It's perfect!
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Have you?
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Right.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Good, good.
Pool.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
They're fine.
It's a long walk.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Aaaahhhh!
The expensive kind.
You well-heeled, partner?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Eddie...
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
A son.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
By all means.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Yes.
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.
Fifth of scotch?
Why?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
You wanna drink?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
I love you.
Yes, I'm glad.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Why should I?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Yeah. That's right, too.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Let's go.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You're not them.
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Where's your car?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Why, yes.  Why?
Yes.
Where, Jimmy?
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
He's a good man.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Just do it!
A countdown to what?
Dad, don't start.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You still got the Olds?
Spunky?
What'd I say?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
But Mr. President...
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
We're being exterminated.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Roger.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
You know me...
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Air... water... your "sun."
What do you want us to do?
What is it?
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
An old man's dream.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No. You like the way I do things.
Don't know. Think of something.
So it did.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
It's important!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
If only I could have been with you.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
My Diary's in Berlin.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
And do I detect a rebuke?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Thanks.
It happens to me all the time.
This could be close.
I don't need camels.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
You should have been there...
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Why they glow like that?
What?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
A snake!
What?!
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
THE WHAT?!
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Dr. Jones?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
So now they believe me.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
You got it!
You're not gonna believe this...
Al.
This candid camera?
What street?
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Why don't you?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah...Who is?
Thanks.
Take a left and your next right.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Nothing!
Just scratched my arm, why?
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
What?
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Well you did it today.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
That's a big if.
Killer!
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
One of your instincts?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Drink lots of water.
Probably.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Rene?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
Yeah, sure.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
You have nothing...
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
Thanks.
Well...
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
...Rene.
Yes, of course.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
He didn't.
Why?
Get your things.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
What?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What did you tell them?
Why?
I love you too.
Yeah...I have to get away.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
What about the others.
A drink...
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Tear it apart?
It'l be alright.
What does he know?
In the backyard.
P.J.'s.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
...fuck is this? Fuck!
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Then what are you going to do?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Catch you later.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes"?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
All right. See you...
What's this?
Good.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Everything interests me.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
How much would I get paid?
Like what?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Good.  You have kids?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Jeff...
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
I heard.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Well, I wouldn't say --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
No...
Why in God's name would I want...?
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
It's your move, Miles.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
No. I haven't. Have you?
Gotcha.
Marylin! Listen to me.
So I hear. Is that all?
Howard is a beautiful person.
From a -- girlfriend.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
May I come in?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Murder?
You used his credit card.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
So. Now what?
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
I don't have a pre-nup
Ah.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
In anticipation of making you sick.
HA!
Mother?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's Rex's guy?
How is she?
Yeah.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Who said anything about a reward!
You're a peculiar chap.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Why don't you put me in chains?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Stunt?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Oh—the papers—
Why, you ungrateful brat!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Smart aleck!
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Yeah?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
What are you talking about?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What!
know—but—
Here. Eat your head off.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
You're an expert, I suppose.
Clever.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Eat a carrot.
Yeah, swell.
Why not?
Do you know?
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Thanks.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Who's she gonna marry?
I ain't got a hat.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Mush. Mush.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Hey, you!
What's the idea?
Wife?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Sure. Anything you say.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
You know you keep saying that.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Gee, thanks boss.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Dave?
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
I see.  And where did you drive?
Why Galveston?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Why?  What's wrong?
And Shaw?
That's our case!
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
How many shots you say you heard?
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
What?
A bit.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Ordell pick up his bond?
It was the other guy who busted me.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
I don't care.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Why?
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
What do you tell Nicolet?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
What if I plead guilty?
What the fuck is that shit?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Who's the other one?
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I never have. It's not my money.
That would be one point of view.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Kinda.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You betcha.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
A woman.
Managers get ten percent.
Who?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Designer clothes.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Sure.
Where at?
Four years?
Really, I'm impressed.
I thought you were sixteen.
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
Yeah.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
No.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Uh-huh?
All right already.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
As low as two.
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Who was Beaumont?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
In the chest and stomach.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Tell me.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Did the police contact you?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Beaumont worked for you.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And where's Jackie?
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
You sure?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Well, how do I look?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Tell your mother.
Don't go.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Shit!
How do you know?
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What?
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I know.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Likewise.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Yes.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Where is the lamp?
I don't know.
Jezzie, I can't see.
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
What's in here?
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
What?
How's it going?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Where are we?
Why? What for?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Let go!
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
What's gotten into you?
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where have they gone?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
You've lived with me for two years.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Oh?  Where you going?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where have they gone?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
One drop?
Yeah, you and everyone else.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Please come quietly.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Speaking.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
You in trouble?
Who is?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
What do you mean?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Bring it in.
He doesn't like it.
Pour it in.
Alright, asshole.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Get out of here!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
We could convert fission transistors.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Hey, easy now.
You're a teacher.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
I guessed.
What if we don't?
Were you close to your father?
You?
I get it.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
GO, GO, GO!
Just get us to the ship!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You prefer an apple?
Crutch?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Who are you apologizing to?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Three...two...one...
It's okay.
Just a favor for your old man.
You got it.
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
He's taken him!
Can you do that?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Sure he is.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Who are you?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
You could say that.
Our friend, the shark.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
This is quite a place.
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
Pretty stiff.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
He's busy.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
I don't think so.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I miss it too.
Yeah. That was me.
You know it's okay.
No... I guess not.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Hon, did you get expelled?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Wow, dream big!
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
What? My eyes are not lying!
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
What do you play?
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
No, more commercial stuff.
I wrote that.
No, he's the dad.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
No?
Vanessa, right?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Wow! It's magical.
Yeah, like people in love.
I am a suicide risk.
Unfortunately, yes.
That is sick, man.
It was magnificent, man!
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
What?
Right, seriously.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
They're yellow.
Adele for god sake please lis...
That French ain't it?
...Yeah.
You can?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.
Early, you are so sweet.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Best kind.
How much do I owe you?
...Then some.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Then try again, 
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
She wasn't feeling so good.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Who are you?
With how many people?
Did what take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
To what? Virgins?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Yeah.
Yep.
Right.
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So.
Fifteen for me.
Yeah probably.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Yeah.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Nothing?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Here. Swallow.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Were you protected?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Yeah?
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
I know.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Hell yeah, they don't know.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
I only did it once and...
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
It's like...
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Hello?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
I can't man.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
I'm positive.
Sit down!
Local?
You think he's dirty?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
Did you know her?
Why not?
Not really.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Please... wait.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
No problem.  We're in.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Has he gotten through to any?
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Who's Kathy?
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
The most logical choice.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Are we going to go through this again?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
He knows you're aware of that.
Then I'll transpose.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
No.
That's a very personal question.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Of course.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Why not?
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
We're almost married.
Yes.
The Fortress moves?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
I will find her!
Can she be forced?
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
I chose the wrong passage.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
You have done it?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
That I promise you.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
What kind of friend do you think I am?
You had better manners as a pig.
Hush!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
The new King.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
We had no children.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
No?
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
OK.
OK.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda?!
What shall we do?
...Why didn't he close the window?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...One second.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Then...
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
How long does this... Mania last?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
I'll kill you!
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Show me.
Please tell me.
Who's telling this story?
By car right?
Mammoth.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Yes.
Walking where?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
She knew you loved her.
I do.
It's mine to risk.
Oh, that's not mine.
Hello.
It's yours.
What are my choices?
Orange soda?
Water?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Very clever.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
What did they look like?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
But it's a top three school --
I believe we are.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
No, she'd stashed it by then.
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
Thank you!
About the alibi --
Yes, I am.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Just the love in my heart.
What'd you do?
That's terrible!
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Thanks again for your help!
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
I can't.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What do you think?
Absolutely!
What?
So are you!
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Harvard. Law school.
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
I gave her my word, Warner.
See?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Then we smash 'em?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
What do you want with me?
Not from me, surely...
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Oh, yes...
I didn't know... I --
You come stealee tleasoo?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
I meant no disrespect.
And if I cannot?
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I fear she's lost.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
What do I do?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
And who might that be?
Knaves and robbers...
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Aye!  That too.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Jack, don't!
What know you of fields of war?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
That's it!
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Be patient.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Shhh!
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
In the dark... where I join him...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Sam!
Mom said I should.
Oh.
Who are you?
What color?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
What's that?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Why are you so stupid?
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
Not really.
What?
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
You've been good this week.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
If that's what it takes.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Maybe that's too long.
Thank you.
I want you both to stay.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
To check up on me?
You'll have money when you work for it.
I might have a solution.
You're too fucking late.
Nothing.
What do you know about me?
Sun glasses?
After everything.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
At least your father tried, George.
Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
Where is he?
Four days.  I left to think.
Money?
I love those doors.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
One of you would end up dead.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
You've never said that before.
You bit my finger.
You got any weed?
I'll make you something.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I never asked for more.
Can you stay for dinner?
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Yeah.
Better make it a week.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
But you can't.
Is Spanky here?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I don't think so.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
So?
You know what I'm saying.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Don't touch that car.
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
Go where, Ray?
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Are you offering me a bribe?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Jenny?
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
So excited.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
She's so nice.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Well, let's rock and roll.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Now you're talking.
Son, just do your best.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
My perfume?
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Why did you do that???!!!
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Sad? What made you sad?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Later.
I'm listening.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
You're sure you don't want to try?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I don't..
That's tomorrow.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
You're not going, are you?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
It's the only way.
And yours.
Then the answer's yes...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
One in a million, I suppose
To what?
Is it inside the city?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
For as long as I can remember.
Are there any other humans?
Have any other people ever passed through?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
No, no, no
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
Okay.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
What's he do?
Okay.
Yes.
Alice, I...
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Yeah.
What happened to me?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
No, sir, it's not.
Coming up.
Nothin'.
He won't give his name.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
From the club. You didn't answer.
Who the hell owns that dog?
Thanks, guys.
But...
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
What'd I tell ya.
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
You're my man, Pete.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't know.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Gold. You were going to—
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Why, you look beautiful.
Leaving?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
We follow many.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Shall we have another?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Please let me help you.
Now, what would you like to do?
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Oh, immediately.
Father Perrault is dead.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Hey!
Yes.
What is it, my son?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Right, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me go, Bob!
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
The clothes?
What was that?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Bump?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
You'll wait till you rot!
All right, I'll be there.
I guess I lost:
Mrs. Edelson?
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Sir--
Sir, you can't just--
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Get back in the car!
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
in case I need it?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I wanna make a deal.
Scientific American?  Really?
Come again?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Forget that guy --
He'll turn around.
Anderton --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
And replace them with new ones.
Whatever you say, John.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
-- go blind.  I know.
Kill type?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Lara --
Uh-huh...
Don't apologize, John.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Yeah?  So?
Now look at him...
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So now I need you to hack into her.
Uh, I'll try...
Oh, Sean --
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Who said I would?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Kill me!
I'm... not... a... killer.
And how would I know that?
You're talking about the precogs...
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
The safest place of all.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
He's dead, Lara.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Where are you?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Yes.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I know who you are.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
It was nobody's fault.
What are you talking about?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Should I fuck him?
I know.
She's, uh, sleeping.
Chloe?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
5-5-1.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Ricky's taken care of.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
Why?
She was fast, huh?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
No. Just the cross streets.
Ruiz isn't here.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
I think we might.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Fuck him.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Oh really. Why's that?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
They asked who it was.
This is bullshit, man.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You got something to say --
Fuck this.
Back in.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Where?
The what?
The penguin house.
All the more reason.
You did?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
No. I'll wait here.
Bobby and Ricky.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Cool. See you later.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
You strapped?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
You want another drink?
Here...
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Different.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're going to New York?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Goodbye.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Heard where?
How 'bout that?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
What?
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
The bitch was there.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to. God knows I want to.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Come, sit with us.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
What have you set your mind to?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
What do you think?
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
The talk is everywhere!
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
We need you too!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Let some of us come down there.
You put it very well.
Allah Akbar.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
And like a fool I believe it.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You hear me, girl?
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
I'm the man.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Deal.
Where?
[Si.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[How do I recognize him.]
[Lucky how?]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Yes or no?
If they like me.
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
That's right.
No.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
No, that was in Columbia.
Yeah. Two or three.
Could I stop you?
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Be a swimmer.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Because...  I was already dead.
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Do you know what she told me last night?
For an American she understands this country very well.
She's young. She'll get over it.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
What?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Where?
Down there. That little one there.
We just talked.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Who told you that?
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What happen?
Who?
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Who?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I'm thirty-four.
I really should get home...
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
No...
So I'll call you tomorrow.
What?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Are you kidding?
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Sure.
What, Ma?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
What nurses?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Where?
Pour one for Painless.
Look at that right eye.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
He can't take much more time on the table.
We been had.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You betcher ass, Dad.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
I like an olive.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
I think we could still have a chance.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Same here.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
I didn't have much choice.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Just in dreams?
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Yes, sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
I out-coached that General Hammond.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Against what?
You got me.
Oh. Yeah.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Yeah, that's the one.
How much money do you get?
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
What?
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Right here. Sit down.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Has he been here?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Yeah, a little.
Where'd you play?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
The heelots!
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Racket? What do you mean?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Am I gettin' the car?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Yeah.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Yes.
To save lives.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
So what do you want to do?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Stay put.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I've proved that, didn't I?
Ronnie...
Do it!
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
SHIT!
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You let us worry about that.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
-- No.
True.  But why?
Then what?
The new world.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
I'm South Dakota.
Who?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Who are you?!
Her?
But you were with me.
This.  No point to it.
Just like that --
Resurrection.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
Ah... sure.
Did I say anything?
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Poor, yeah.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Ben-jamin.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
The kid just called me stupid.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
I turned him down flat.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Come on. Be polite.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Yeah...before your time.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Back? You're sending me back?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Why?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I need a new PR guy.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
The ring...
Give me a date, Doctor.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
You don't like where I live?
... What are they all doing there?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
But I was dusting.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
I'd love to.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
What happened?
What does he do?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Forty-five all total.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Who?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Any time.
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
What?
You said it!
What is it?
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
How do you feel, champ?
Yes, Jim.
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Uh--could--could I help--?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Ah, now, that's better.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
You're a liar!
The man downstairs said number--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Thanks a lot.
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Where do we go from here?
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
And how's your bill, Senator?
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Well, well!
No?
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
But--if he *does*, Joe--
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes, I—
He was a seven-months baby.
Sometimes twice.
And sings.
He sure is pixilated.
Yes, indeedy.
No.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are they true!
Yes, but I—
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
What's that got to do with it?
What happened?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Tell me more about yourself.
What did they say?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Can I have a month's vacation?
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
When're you going to see him again?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Sure.
That's the rub.
Hello . . .
Right.
Shhh!
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Mr. Cedar!
You can't?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Okay.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Why should you?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Uh-huh.
Entertainment?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
I'm Chairman.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Oh, Mr. Deeds—
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Well, I play the tuba.
Not at all.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Is Mary home?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
You have no pants, sir.
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Yeah.
Good kids.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Ernest, what do you think?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What?!
What do you do?
Yes.
What?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Sure.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What?
No, I really don't.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Okay...
I think so.
You're not the only one...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
What is your name?
Will you be here?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yep.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Definitely.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
You're completely reliable.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
What'd I do?
Well, okay then.
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
I've had worse.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I am an English woman.
Two hundred pounds.
What are you doing here?
Broad?!
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
Really want to know?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Picked his pocket, actually.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Oh.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Are you with me... or against me?
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
So are you!
I'm not that kind of girl.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Alone tonight?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Bye. 
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
We had an off night, that's all.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
I'll drive.
I can't.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
No.
The Eradicators!
Not yet.
Ow.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It is?
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
Proceed.
Ah -- you approve?
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
I did, sir.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
It is a terrible shock.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
No, sir, none at all.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, I am.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
No, sir.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Junot?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
All right -- I promise.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
It's me.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Certainly.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
I know.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Of course, my dear.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
We have a treaty with Austria.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
That is a matter of opinion.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Send him in.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Good.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
Can I look for myself?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
You don't know Baby D.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I don't.
Still gonna smell it.
Wait for what?
No, man, just wait.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Okay.
I said hold on!
Well bring yo' ass on...
All damn.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
This is a knock.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Good, let's get out.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Shut yo' ass up.
Sorry.
Yes?
My security people are right next door.
I have a problem.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
No way.
I know you do, honey.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
Keep it.
Please. Something is going to happen...
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
A surprise?
Yeah.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Young love.
Only you.
Just put her on.
He carried on some; kicked.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You, Preacher?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
So you ain't with the State no more?
How do you mean?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
It's a shame!
What!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Ssh...
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
No. No.
It -- she --
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
All right.
Can I have my supper please?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
The Drugstore?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Used to. Not anymore.
Yeah.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Meanwhile...?
What?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
Deal.
Krueger?
I will.
Okay.
Nancy!
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
The door was locked from your side.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
It's from Paris.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I have nothing to hide.
Yes.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
But, Comrades...
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Yes.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
While you eat, you look at the view.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Why should I take a chance?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Your type will soon be extinct.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I will do my best.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's twelve o'clock.
Oh, let it ring.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I didn't follow you.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
A funny story?
No speech?
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
Those newspaper people?
What does he say?
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Hello.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Unfortunately.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I don't understand.
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
To protect his people.
How so?
Jesus!  Through a window?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Just do what I say, Bob.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Why me?
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Thou must.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
Winning?
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Agreed.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Why?
That has the added virtue of being true.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Hello ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Fire him.
No, sir ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're not a failure, Dick.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Because ... I have to relax.
And what am I doing?
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
How come're you doin that?
Try "old" on for size.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
I don't know. Oh.
Yes Sheriff.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Hyah!
I never do.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I wouldn't worry about it.
No. But I gave my word.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
Big talk.
What're you goin' to do?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Uh-huh.
Llewelyn?
No me mate.
You from around here?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
With anything?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Sir?
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
How's that?
Sir?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Yessir. I understand that.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
You want to change rooms?
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
Took me about three hours.
Yes.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
No. You don't.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
You think a woman did that?!
Any idea where it is?
I know plenty.
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Umm, I don't think that...
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
What are you talking about?
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
No, Del.
You never gave us a chance...
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Uh-huh.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Roy! What are you doing here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
How many men have I talked to?
What? Where was he?!
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
If we're for real?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
He told us it's in the Buick.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
I'm not telling.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
It just didn't fit her profile...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
I see.  May I?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I don't know, George...
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Would you say she was ambitious?
No... before that.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
I swear to God!
Mr. Campbell?
Waitaminute -
Do not seek the treasure!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I joined the Navy.
Yeah, I know.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Great. You can go in my place.
No, sir!
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
No.
No, sir.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
But in what ways?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
What do you mean?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I'm starving.
That's it?
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
No. Is that what you want?
Why?
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Remember that.
Please...
I can't...
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
You finish.  Then we finish.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Adios.
Huh?
Oh, that phone call...
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Master closet.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
No, Edgar Allen.
Open the door.
What?!
They're coming in here, aren't they?
On it!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Huh uh.
What if I keep dropping?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Man, fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
No man. Gonna walk.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
That would be nice.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
He's my father.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Sir?
Sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
It's already over.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Please.
Gabriel.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
What are my orders?
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
God willing.
Bite?
Yes--
Yaay!
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yayyy!
Do you believe that?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Good for you.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Wendigo?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Yes.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
It's beautiful!
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I just said--
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Louis, are you sure?
I will.
Aye, aye, sir!
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
That's fair.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Thank you, sir.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
You're speaking up for him again?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I know where your heart truly lies.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
That he is.
She can hold a bit longer.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I said, no lies.
Pirate.
No.
How?  The key's run off.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father.  William Turner?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
It's the right way.
And no lies!
But --
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
You're not rotting meat.
She says it's not.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
That remains to be seen.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
The replicators?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
What are you going to do?
You're looking for a urine sample.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
You know, this and that.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
It already is.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
The nanobot.
That's right.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
The head shrinker at the prison.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
I have to!
I guess they do.
It's a miracle.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Your house?
Why—
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
I certainly will.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Yeah - go on.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Your valet, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Here you are.
Sorry, boss—
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Yes - the worm!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
It's haunted just the same.
Yes sir.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
I'm fine.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Hello Bill.
It's alright.
I don't know.
But where would we go?
Why not?
With what?
What?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Well--it was dark out ...
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
No way.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
What happened?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
Owns the hardware store.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
He won't notice anyway.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Nothing.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
They're happy like this.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
It's okay.
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
And you're sure about this?
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Sure ...
Scout?
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
BUD.
NOW!
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Listen to me!
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
No, that's not it.
TV repair?
Yeah ...
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Yeah but what are you doing?
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
Somewhere in Utah.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
That's your fault not mine.
I'm trying to be your friend.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
This is Georgia.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
...yeah.....
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Yes.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
It was cool last night.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes no not really.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
Ok. Have a good trip.
This is Lena.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
...what...?
Yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
I don't know.
I know.
......and this is confidential?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
What's that for?
I'll say whatever I want --
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
...I'll tell you later.
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
What happened?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
Alright, alright.
Yes. Sorry.
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Ok.
When can you leave?
What's the problem?
Sorry.
It's fine.
I'm sorry. You're right.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Once or twice.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
There I was taxed; it's true.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
I saw the longing in your eye --
It's a formality; truly.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
You'd suffer in her stead?
Yes?
Quite.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
What's that then?
I don't believe it!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
You've come to lecture me?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You're just scared.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
And he did.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
And director.
So I've been told.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Yeah
Marion--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I don't want you to--
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
That's right
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Orson. Stop. Just stop
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
I don't have it anymore?!
But it's not a great syllable
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
It's too late. The movie's made
Herman.
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
That's for me to decide.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Again.
Again
CITIZEN KANE
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
The ad..
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
I really think you're
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Happy birthday.
Yes!
I'm Christ
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Yeah --
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
When?
Well, I heard some things.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Does that mean...
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Come here.
Oh, Jake.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You're not interested in him?
You're a fuckin' liar.
You did?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
What?
I don't know.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
I think they missed their chance with her.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Ever get an answer?
Mrs. Thorwald.
For getting rid of that cast.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Tell her to bring it back!
Well, I only quote from the best.
It crashed, didn't it?
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
What?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Not yet, Jeff.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Tired?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
You mean "goodnight."
So do I.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
What's the apartment house number?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
I don't know.
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Still -- those witnesses.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
I do?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Okay.
I like you, you know?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Down in back.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Yeah!
That's funny!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
You what?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Plato.
In my mother's drawer.
Come back tomorrow.
No.  I don't think so--
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Who knows.  Plato?
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Why?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
What's that got to do with it?
Leave me alone.
Chicken?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
See?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Goodbye!  See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I'm getting that way, too.
I'm never going back.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
So do you.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Daddy--
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Why?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
I've been doing good, though.
He'll be dead when he does.
No, hey, I like your coat --
What.
No, c'mon --
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, I love you --
Nick died for me....
Jack. Jack Bangs.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
What?
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
Part of... with them?
Keep 'em there for a little while.
No --
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
Bam Bam.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
NO!
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
You need six.
No.
I'm no threat without a gun.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Leave the tree.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How do we take them out?
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
It's a roach, guy --
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Yeah.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Yes.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
You ain't dying, he is.
Was he all pissed off?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
What? Snap out of it!
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I don't like alarms.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Let's go in the other room...
Uh-uh, just cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We don't think this place is safe.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Just about.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Hold on.
But the rest is right.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Maybe they will.
Why?
So did I. They were in it.
How's that?
A man I used to know.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Why?
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
I won't again.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
You want to split up? --
I said I didn't care.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
They shouldn't have done that.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
We don't want to go there.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Everybody knows --
Up the trail.
Yeah, we sure have.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
No. We're not stayin' --
Then I know my alphabet.
And you've got me all figured out?
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
If you need me, I'll be --
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
She killed herself a week before he died.
It's okay.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Not in a thousand years.
Both of them?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Uh, uh.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Saw who?!
Any of them hot?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Even in the bathroom?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Of course. So sexy.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
I guess so.
What she said about your mother?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Mrs. Sutphin?
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Always the dentist.
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Let me see!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
But, Chip...
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
No woman would!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
Shhhh..
Ooohhhh!
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
I didn't do it!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
You think my sister is there?
Drink.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
She could use a hundred dollars.
What circumstances?
She showed me a drawing.
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
But you do believe me?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
I'd like that.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
I keep telling myself that.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
She was my patient.
I've lost my knack.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
I'd like that.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
Of course.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
You play an instrument?
Lawyers.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Don't you want to make one?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
Then do it.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Sometimes. Afterward.
Yes.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
No.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
I've told you.
Yes.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Who'd you have lunch with?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Loud.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Radon leakage?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Yes.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
What?
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
What's wrong with that?
No, I didn't.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
It's a sun dress.
Well. I can't stay.
It was busy.
The extrovert.
Spooked.
Yes.
Just a moment.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Then what happened?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Is that what he tells you?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
When?
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
You told Ann about this?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
My keys?
Shut up!!!
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Sure.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I don't get it.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?

Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.

Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes, Betty.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
You too, Betty!
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.

TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
I know.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
F for...
Foods!
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
Say, is Maya working?
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
You are not.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Sure is tasty.
And?
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
That's your problem, Miles.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
And get your bone smooched.
Want some?
Perfect.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
Well, she is cute.
Did you drink and dial?
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Right now.
What the fuck are you doing?
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
You're an asshole.
I don't want to talk about it.
No.
What?
I know what you need.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
You need a new car anyway.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
What about me?
Good. So did I.
What rehearsal dinner?
I'm sure he believed every word.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
Me too.
I see.
I'm not going to curse.
Just make noises then.
That's right.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They're right behind the door.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
I'm close.
Have they said anything about our area?
It needs batteries.
They win.
The family room.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
You'll lose the signal!
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
No money, eh?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Did it seem short to you?
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Where's Jake?
Is he alive?
They've been kind to me.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
My name is Emmett.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
You got no idea what they were after?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I was afraid of that.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
Why would they stop you?
Because they enjoy it.
I heard that too.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
You're right.
It is that.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
Oh, yeah? How good?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
I am telling the truth.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
What about it?
Even the fall from the plane.
Simone does not control my destiny.
You really think so?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
You?
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Of course.
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Is that a problem?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
This week anyhow.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
This is the story.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
It's a yacht.
-- I bet you have.
Yes, very.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
What if it catches on fire?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
... digitized.
The only real truth is in the work.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Thanks.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You mean aneurysm.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
Something I want?
I forgot myself.
Yes.
Cats?
Soon. One week.
You believe me, right?
No, we're not.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
I guess she did.
Oh.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Tell you my secrets.
...I don't know.
They used to hang people here.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
Superstition.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Not according to these.
Which street corner?
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Who you callin' "boy?"
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
About what?
It's you. You and your father.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Like your guitar break.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Why bother?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
No, Starla! No!
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Sure you do.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Out.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Grant, you're sick!
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Who'd want to?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Eyes on the road.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Uh-oh.
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
I'll do it.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Six. Got it.
Redneck heaven.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Not for long, you ain't.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Of course. Yes.
And who has access to that floor?
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
No.
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
And threw us into the lake.
Pretty much, yep.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
...He does now...
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
I don't see it like that at all.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
What were you doin' here anyway?
What!?
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
What's the time frame?
I can trust Rheya.
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Not necessarily.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Get out --
No.
What plan?
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Maybe you can.
I'll just be a minute.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
It's something.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
As I said, then it's God, right?
What kind of look?
Yes.  Yes.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I can't stay here.
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Uh...
Can we go then?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Tell it like it is.
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
Let go!
I don't know.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I'll think about Wednesday.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
I can still use a gun.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
You don't want to hear about it.
I'd identify him.
I had to follow her to a store.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Did you hear what I said?
You talked to his wife?
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
It should've been me...
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
You should'a brought the girl.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
You stop him?
No…not really.
Or was it all a dream?
I'm parked illegally!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry…
I got you a present.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
I hate people with alliterative names.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Does it have a human name?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Well, no.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
So you've found Thorkel?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
I know him.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Aunt May, what happened?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Phooey on that.
We did not.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
What's the match gag?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
You are talking crazy!
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
105-353.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What's the award?
No?
You did?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Hey, Animal! Animal!
You have a Lieutenant here...
Any objections, men?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Anybody cover?
You off your rocker?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You can tell Father Murray to --
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
December seventh, forty-one.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Here. Take them.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Where is he?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Agreed.
You get what?
One minute to warp core breach.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Better?
That's right.
That's right.
Phasing? To where?
A photon torpedo?
No.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
Execute!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
A photon tube...!
Short range scan.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I don't understand.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Come on!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
But -- why?
Then, how --
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Thank you.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
I know, I know...
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Ssssh!
I'm Doctor Marcus!
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
KHAN!
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Admiral --
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Scotty, can we make it inside?
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Take the test again.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Stage Two of what?
<u>WHAT</u>?
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Trying, sir!
Try again.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Ready, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Never, sir.
Where must you go?
You do this -- for friendship?
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
I liked him better before he died.
Well nobody's perfect...
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
All right. The truth?
Noon tomorrow...?!
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Picture, please.
Picture, Uhura!
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Mr. Sulu?
I'll have to re-energize.
Of course.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Most kind, Father.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
I am better.
Really?
Sometimes I do.
Won't he rust?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
It is not over.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
I'll be in Engineering.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
Sir?
Make it so.
No, sir...
Why was Data assigned?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Whatever makes you comfortable...
But it's comfortable.
Yes...
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
You think they're still up there?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
At least four hours.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I am the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Understood. Keep me informed.
Let's go.
I have the password right here.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Ready.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
You don't sound French.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Aye, sir.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Unless you'd like to stay.
What?
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
I'll keep that in mind.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Target...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We're not finished.
Are we playing multiple choice?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
We were until your torpedoes!
Barely.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
How can I trust --
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
Spoken by you?
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Kill him! He's the one!!
It IS possible.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
Aye, sir.
I always wanted to try that.
Sir?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
An omission. After that -
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
You can't prove any of this...
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Nevertheless.
Would they?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
No.
For how long?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
That was another time.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
On my way.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Divert power and compensate.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Understood.
Not with the Romulans.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
No?
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
I won't defend my life to you.
And what of the Enterprise?
But you want to.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
No -- this is wasting time.
Seven minutes.
What?!
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Now go. I have some personal business.

For the moment.
I don't see anything.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
We should have. Let me see.
No.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
You're not hearing me.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Flashlight.
Pancakes.
Gas good?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Closed.
My... husband.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
I want to try it.
Shit!
It was yellow.
You better.
I need you.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
The driver will...
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
Where did you learn that?
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
Yes, they are.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I know how to gamble now.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many, many days and nights...
In the cars, too?!
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
Bullshit!
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
Twenty-eight years.
No.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Make me forget it, baby.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Damn right.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
No.  Mace is in this.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Clips.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
I'm on her.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Looks like she was holding out.
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
No.  Bad idea.
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Define love.
You will not live to see the morning.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Something in your car...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
No, it's not.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Right.  That explains it.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Take the tape to the cops.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
No.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Winona.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
I have 6 tons.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
Look...
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What are you doing?
Please.
Who?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
How long ago?
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
It explains a lot.
Don't even go there. What's up?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
The other reason?
"Gone live?"
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
He's called a couple times.
Just routine stuff.
Sue Ann Hanson.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You did.
I just need to go a little slow.
Jaime? Where are you?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Kulok.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
I already have an employer.
It was the mall.
You? You went by the book?
Lead the way, Murman.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I screwed up twice, sir.
350 miles.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
Shuddup.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
...And she's with someone else.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
No...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Six years.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
No, no. Hold on.
What kind of things?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Why didn't you call?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Well that sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
No problem.
I mean, I need the money.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I'll give you an eight. 
I just tested for one...
Well, let's hit that party.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Go for it, man.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
She's really special, guys.
What Vegas?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
They're all skanks.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That's bullshit.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...Baby...
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
You looked right at her, baby.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
...It's on.
See, baby?
What was cold about it?
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...it's on.
...it is so on.
I'll come to you when I need you.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
How bad will it be?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
Sure.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Michael...
What time do they expect us?
No.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
How's Mom?
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Maybe.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Yes, I promise.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Sure.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
Sure. I love Venice.
No!
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Freddie?
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
What club?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I've got plans!
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
What?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
I love Marge.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I'm sure we've met.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
My fiancée.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
What does that mean?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
You were going to Venice.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Oh Marge.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Right.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Beating you away.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Yes?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
What about Ripley?
November 7th is my information.
No!
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
I got money.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
Nah. I ain't interested.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What kind of people?
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What do you mean?
I mean porno movies.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Keep it.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
No, why?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Well... I guess so.
I don't like my real name.
That's what you think.
Oh, come off it, man.
Can I see you again?
Pittsburgh.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
No.
Why, thank you Travis.
Yes.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Yes, Sir.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Oh?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah?
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
You know how I feel about what you do.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
You mean,  me?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
How'd they get it inside?
Whoa.
Yeah...
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Oh.  Okay.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Go ahead, son.
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
But what?
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
I know, I know... keep still.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
She's very pretty.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not at all.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
I can play the piano?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
No.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you.
Yes?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
How do you like our little hamlet?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I did.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Just listen to them!
Take them.
Your brother told me.
Could I have a puff?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Morning.
Yep.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Okay.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
That's a chance we have to take.
When?
But they'll be back.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I started to say... inside...
Cathy. At the school.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Goodnight, Lydia.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Yes.
Certainly, but...
Oh. That. Rome.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
No, tell me.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Of birds?
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
What time is it?
Yes.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Yes, certainly. 
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
With smoke.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
I'm only a student.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
MacFarlane
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
I remember her.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Gray killed her.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
It was a woman when we put her in.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
Afraid of what?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I have other means of sustenance.
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
Nearly a year.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You sent them. I had no choice.
The strip joint?
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
Someone else did it.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
My father.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You killed my daughter.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
Yes -- that is true.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Goodnight.
Just Klaatu.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Jittery is the word.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What time is it?
Who?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I was.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
The baddest!
Yeah.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Whatcha doin' over here?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Mom... please.
Smells like something died.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Soon.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Lucy.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
I hope so.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I'm Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I know, I've felt it...
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Huh?...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Just listen.
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Let go of me...
If it did get to him.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
Was dark... find a light...
Cut him loose?
You been made, MacReady.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
Come on, Copper.
Nothing we can do about that.
You reach anybody yet?
I'll put this right through your head.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Who else could have used that key?
The journey is part of my work.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
Where?
The Hall of Books.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
It was meant to.
Why did they built it?
Vox...
I don't understand.
I'll never forget this.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
Because...
I need to... um... talk to you.
I mean... well... affection.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
I've seen it.
God, and I'm running late --
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Oh?
For God's Sake, David --
I live with it every minute of every day.
What is it?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
His home.
Thank you...
Thank you.
That machine --
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
You can see so many here.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes.
What are you?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Yes.
Mara --
Here?
That'll be all.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
No...
I suppose so.
We are what we are.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
[Beat] Thank you.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
You two ok?
Jackie.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Yeah.
What?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Good. How's your mom?
I'm doing fine.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
The future doesn't look different?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Who told you this?
[Beat] Thanks.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
I'll manage.
No, I'm ok.
Sure.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
You want anything special for dinner?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Who do you think did it?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.  I know.
Right.  Where are they?
Oh, definitely.
Stop.
What for?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Louise is alright.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
That sounds nice.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
I'm a robber.
How?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Who did it?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Who is it?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Front.
I'll call you right back.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
How come he let you go?
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Ready when you are.
Which part?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I think better when I drive.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
That's puttin' it mildly.
I won't wait up.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
You think you've found your calling?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
It won't work.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Yeah.
Hit it.
Just asking.
I said all that?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Good.
We can change our names.
Why?
You're crazy.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
So you admit it?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Yeah, but he was successful.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Yeah, right.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
And this adversely affects me how...?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
Pat Healy.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
I guess.
Uh-huh.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
She's blackmailing you, right?
So she hasn't changed?
Huh?
Oh my.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Oh, are you on the team?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Oh yeah.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
What are you?
I agree there should be more.
Trying to be.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Shhhhhh!
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Zorin will eat him alive!
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Forget it, Scotty.
I was, you bastard.
Not as far as the election goes.
No way.
I don't know. I don't know.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
Cuz you're a cop.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Stop.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
-- your father was part Sioux.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
You saw a MiG 21?
Two miles.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Used to what?
Anything.
It's not suffering anymore.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Where'd you get it.
Not to me.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
Your watch.
Who's gonna win?
I live here, remember?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What?  What is it?
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Not anymore.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Why do they call you Wolf?
Oh...I'll think of something.
I've had enough...for now.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Was.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
Nope.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Goose is dead.
No bother.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
I know.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Why not?
But maybe you can change all that.
How'd you find me?
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
No, sir.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Brunette.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
There!  The woman!
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Let's do it.
Just think about it.
I'm late.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
Nice to meet you.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
As real as any memory in your head.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Some kind of mutation...?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
I'll go with that plan.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
I'm gonna help you.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
They're working together, too.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
"We"?
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
Not necessarily...
No further questions.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
-- Yeah?
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
-- Me? Neither.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
I embroidered.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
That's right.
Exactly what happened then?
"Painted"?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Objection.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
Albert.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
You killed Mike.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Well, where are you going?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
What?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Where's Hap?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
It must be a high priority situation.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
When?
Of course...
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
You're not mad at me?
What can I tell you?
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
I'm not.
Why? It does.
We were supposed to be together.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What do you mean?
You mean the ones you pity.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Abrams...
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Yes.
What is the truth?
What does it mean?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I... yes.
I do. Yes.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
...of Anesthesiology?
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Yes.
That's right.
...that's all right.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Yes.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
You live in the neighborhood?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
One hour.
I was held up.
That happens.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
You, you don't under...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Mr. Alito, please.
From the magazine?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
Who are you protecting, then?
Yes.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I have to stand up for her...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
It hit sideways and skidded in.
I didn't know how to stop you...!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
So is the town, I notice!
They'll probably move at dawn.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Is he all right?
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Say how they find their way back home.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Fred Krueger did it.
I want to see for myself.
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
To take a piss.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
I thought this was your dream come true.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Look, I just better go.
I can't watch this.
Fine.
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Speak up boy!
Close the door.  Sit down.
Twice.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
I should be eating with the crew.
Oh, really?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
A padlock.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
I couldn't do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What is it... the secret?
About yourself?
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
This be it?
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
We don't have no paper bags.
How old are you?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Get out.
No way... GET OUT!!!
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
You heard from Reggie?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
This 'bout the fifth time?
You won't of missed much.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
In a fire, as I recall.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
You up for that?
You mean like pedal pushers?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You certain?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh shit...
Sailor?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
Yeah?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
Shake hands with your daddy.
I'll bet.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Just a place.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
What if I asked you not to?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Take care of him?
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
What?
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
You heard right.
I didn't see nothin'...
He was trying to steal my car!
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Your wife.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
What's to tell?
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
He was never able to reproduce them.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
How long have you been having them?
And your wife left you.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
No. There's no one here.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
You're in Kinship?
Yea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
So what are you doing out here?
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
I had to. Didn't I?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Sure.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
That's a big book you're writing.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
The bus station.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
How can you tell?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Because of my coat?
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
That good, huh?
I'm pregnant.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
James Leer.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I told Walter.
What's that?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Oh?
And?
A jockey? You mean, like --
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
The perpetrator.
Just kidding.
No, I'm going ho --
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
When can I see her?
Huh?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Ah, come on.
C'mon, Walter.
It's not what you think.
Why not?
It's just a city park.
It's a bright sound.
Well... not in the common way.
Robin.
Got something to hide?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
I fell asleep.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I went to bed around seven.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
'Fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
Yes.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Yes you can, Robin.
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
That's right.
Of course.
Bad idea.
Then think about it.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Do you know what "normal" is?
I want to be normal!
What did you think would happen?
Sorry.
What?
Not so fast.
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
Me?
I'll buy a plant.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What?
No you're not.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
It's been a while since...
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Sounds like a special guy.
They seduce you?
What?
Not ever?
Us seeing each other.
Neither am I.
Live together.
I need a shower.
Yeah.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Not in this thing.
Tell me later.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Do we just leave him there?
Missed what?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
How many are there?
How deep?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
Well, what?
It takes even less.
And what about you?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Then why do you say them?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
Better dead.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
And what did they say about me?
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Yes, we will.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
Because...
It's a sin to be fat.
Agnes...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
They were stained.
It's not that... it's not that...
It's not my time of month.
Love.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Agnes, how are babies born?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to be?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
No... do you?
Why should I?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't know.
No, but I can never tell her that.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Agnes...
I'm always bad.
You can tell me.
Yes.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.
Yes.
You're a mistake.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as God loves you.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Will she be angry?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
What else?
Yes.
Why?
So I could go to him.
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Yes.
Yes.
I hate him.
Yes.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
If I find anything I'll call you.
Who are you?
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Yes.
What does this have to do with..?
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Yes... I...
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
What man had access to her?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
About two years before.
Not simple, no.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
What?
Earthquakes?
What sheets?
Your niece!
Because I didn't know... 
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Bullshit!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
Listen to her singing.
No.
For Agnes.
Who is he?
You're saying God did it?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
The baby?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Before or after you killed the child?
Wasn't it!
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Shurrup!
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Of course I can.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
Sorry.
I'll look in here again.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Yes.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is she?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Parading?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
That little old man.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Well you're not going.
Come on speedy!
You've got a midnight matinee.
Temper! Temper!
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Down the ... er ...
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Dell, plot our location.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Don't you remember?
Yeah!
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Right.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Yes.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Good.
Oh my God.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
No.
What do you mean, no?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Oh... God...
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
It's not going to work.
Feast your eyes.
You lead.
How far?
We're going into the freezers now.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Even simple.
We're coming!
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Yeah...
Thanks.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
What?
Just got a reading...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Is it still moving?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Where does that lead to?
Sounds great.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Six month stint on Datus.
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Agreed.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
And what is your name?
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Almost four.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
We're?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
No-no-no...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
That's how you met me. In passing.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Frankly, I don't remember.
I take it she read well.
Huh?
Right here. A minute ago.
Thank you so much.
Where's my coat?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I don't think that's funny!
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Okay. Mix.
Here we go...
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
Margo, let's make peace.
You were great.
Glory Hallelujah.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Just wondered what?
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I just asked a simple question.
So am I.
From what would I be running?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Find out.
The same size?
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
Don't be dense. The party.
You probably won't believe me.
Not at all.
He's the best.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
She's got to meet you-
Hollywood.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
Of course it is.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Ain't it the truth?
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Three or four miles...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Well...
I can't believe Eve said those things!
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Where'd you get all that information?
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Not much.
What is he talking about?
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You'd have been proud of her.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Go ahead, please...
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
How about me what?
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
But what could she do?
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Answer my question!
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--fifteen phone calls--
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
You want me to be the bastard.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--shit, who do we know?--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Tell that to Muskie.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
Hey, easy...
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
The ones who could disburse the money.
I will not talk about the other two.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Haldeman too?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Will you step forward, sir. 
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
You can't believe that.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
A girl. Melissa.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sure.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Single malt?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Neither will I.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
You don't like it?
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Yeah right.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
But that one time --
Do you?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Right.  That gives us...
Yeah, enormous.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
You fuckin' rule!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Whatever you want.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay!
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
You want to do it?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
I don't know.  How do you?
I love you.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Fuck yeah we will.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Also like sex with my wife.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
It's okay. I can see fine.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
I know. He told me.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
What?
And you call me a moron...
Oh shit... No...
Yeah?
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Allo?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
When you're older . . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then come find me.
I'm fine.
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Now just get off the train.
You are the Princess.
It's the best fork of all
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
Rasputin!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Run, Anya -  go...
No. Empress, you --
Young	man, I...
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
You gave the orders!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
What's your name?
M'mm.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
What do you mean, next?
Alvy.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Well, then, w-who was?
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh - you're an actress.
Nice car.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
You want your tennis stuff?
Well...
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll see yuh.
You sure?
M'hm...
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Well, who's Sadie?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Fifteen years, huh?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
H'm?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
Of course.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
No, I'm fine.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Will it change my life?
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Yeah.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
What?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Jesus!
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
It's a narrow view.
Yeah, I love it there.
May I see your license, please?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
You all right?
What difference does that make?
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
You think so? Do you really?
Did you know the contractor?
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Of course.
Oh.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I never put myself in harm's way.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
You really need to be fucked.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah...
A perfect night.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Are you always this much fun?
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Yes.
Through the sweats or not?
Not.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I'm going to throw up.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
That is not true.
Don't do this!
He's my favorite.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Mmm hmmm.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
And you know, he really does not.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
Let's go for a walk.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Okay.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Well...wow...
Yes.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Like the last time.
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
I guess.
And here they are!
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Why are you doing this?
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Invisible!
Divinely?
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Well I guess that makes us even.
Wait, I hear something!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Oh no...
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Ant Team Six...
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Yeah.
Eight-thirty.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
Cheers.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Of course not.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
I'll fix you some coffee.
In his apartment.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Open it.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Cut.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Would you mind opening the window?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Over a girl?
You usually eat alone?
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Mind if I come in?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
What kind of joint are you running?
Swap them? For what?
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You too, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I got kicked in the head, too.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Just as long as she's okay.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
What's this -- you packing?
Who is Mickey?
No.
You got a girl-friend?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
I'm with you, lover.
The party's over.
My shoes.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
A.W.O.L.?
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I love you -- remember?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
All set for what?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
He wouldn't.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
You can keep your fucking fuel --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Which part is that ?
No.
Yeah. Way north.
Let's talk about you.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
No shit.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I'll go with him --
Anyone got a cigarette.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
What, sir?
What?
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
Can you trust them?
Who knows.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
What Truth?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I think think a lie stinks.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Any time -- us -- Americans.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
No -- leave it --
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Well , who's in command here?
Beverly Hills --
Needs patching.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
94   CONTINUED:  
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
168  CONTINUED:
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
How did she..?
The radio's on the fritz.
Why?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Was there any trouble?
That's not what I meant.
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
I don't plan on dying.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Hate to disappoint you.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
You broke the radio, remember?
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
Let's get out of here.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
I'm a waitress.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Will you please take it?
Sorry.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
What needs clearing up?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What you did changed my life.
Thank you.
You take off when you have to.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
And?
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
I had to see you...
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
How to die, mostly.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Wait here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Absolutely not.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Right.
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
You would be.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
I know.  It was a joke.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
I work for the government.
Yeah?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Ten million --
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
'Them'?
Until a minute ago.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
No.  Just Electra.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
How did you get into the business?
You went from high school to the Agency?
The exotic women.
Women?  No... not really.
After that?
Good.
I don't know.
Sorry.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Okay.  Then what?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
No.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Attraction is a complication?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Was she the only one?
Shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Everyone regrets something.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Go ahead.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Like you?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Can you do the lock on it?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, I'll take some.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Like helping a sick kid?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
So why didn't we?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
What happened to Katka?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
What are you on about?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
I don't want to ruin your day.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Siberia.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
I'm not hungry, really.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
No, by road?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Whatever!
What?
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
No way Doug, I can't.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But I love you!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Great....How long will it go for?
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
What is bail?
You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Thanks.
What's the Bugler?
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Cool!
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Yeah.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
I'll tell her you were here.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Late night.  You?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- Obviously.
You don't know me.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
-- This play means a lot to me.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
Good thing.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
You think so.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Yeah --
You're hardly nice to anyone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
Prove it.
What?
It's only 7:30.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Where's the one you're building?
Yes, one of many.
No.
Where? Why?
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I should have told you sooner --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Anything you want.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Yes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
It was a play.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
When do I get time for me?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
Learn anything?
Good.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
In the parking lot, with her.
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
So what? We'd be rich!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
We don't....
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
What theater was I at?
Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
You lost that one?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
No.
Sure.
Well, stop the world.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't blame him.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Stay as long as you like.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
What?
Same one you had yesterday?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
It?  Who does?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Everybody okay up here?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Absolutely.
It's too dangerous.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
A what?
Pictures don't lie.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
...I know this must look... funny.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
...Who is this?
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
You wrote his scripts for him?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Bill –
Chet!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Just Bill, please.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Pictures! Jesus!
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Hold on –
Hold on –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I apologize, Barton.
Congratulations.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US –
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
When did you start drinking again?
She was there, wasn't she?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
Who?
What was she like in school?
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
If that's the way you want to play it.
It won't last.
I have nothing to hide.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
No, thanks.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
You can make a mistake.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
To see if he can get away with it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Fine.  How's your back?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
He had a girlfriend?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
I got tired of being played with.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You don't like punk rockers?
I feel fine!
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Yeah.  I know.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Are you vice?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
That's good. At least they're interested.
How much for these five?
You want a drink?
How about right now?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Really?
What's wrong with you today?
Who am I?
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
Staten Island would be ok.
What's wrong with me?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
What's that about?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Some of them.
Stand still.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Yeah.
Hanging on every word.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
My lips are sealed.
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Specify, please.
You are going back to school.
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
What exactly are you doing?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
She knows who we are.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
But soon...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I wish I knew.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Adam and Evil.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Our work?
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Hardly a worry, sir.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Apology hastily retracted.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
He ran away?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
What do maniacs always want?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Four seconds from...
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Exactly.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
And now....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I don't want to remember!
Stop fighting.
You do know. Try.
What?
Excuse me.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Bruce, you can't.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I got family. ...Please.
A man with a death wish.
Let's see if you bleed green.
About what?
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
... Very good, sir.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
... Murderer...
... Where are you taking me?
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
I wish you'd...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I feel naked without it.
Finding out where she is.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Are they paying you for all this?
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Not what?
Holy shit. Holy...
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Sort of half.....
Meaning?
About Charles...
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Well, Ahm....
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Right.  Got it.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Er ... pray tell me why?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first?
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Not now Bork.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
She sure does.
Uh, ten uh...
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
I am sitting.
That's my girl!
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Wait.
Then it should be here.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
All right.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We tried.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
You're the dead.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
Are you a spirit too?
Yeah.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Oh, as long as we're here...
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
The attic.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
... Straight out?
Yes, Robert. I will.
No, Robert.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I wish he were here...
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I agree.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
I am a very good gardener.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Hello, Sid.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I don't want Robert.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
I want to tell Eve.
I can't write.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I see.
Is his back feeling better?
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes. That is surprising.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Compensated...?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
But you won't sign, correct?
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... Nothing.
Sid, it's useless!
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you need a secretary?
Good evening, Wilson.
It's not that, I just...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Us, of course.
Me and John.
Shut up!
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's Elijah.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Let me try!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Money, Miss Warts?
Yex?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What's he been in?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Maxine...
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Great then.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Then what do I do?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
You remember Halle.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
What you want'em for?
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
She likes this dress...
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
All he can. All he can.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
You got to get up from here, girl.
She left me. She's gone again.
Make it the way I always do.
Yes sir.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Come and get it.
And this guy peed on it.
Walter, how--
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Lebowski on the right?
Are these.
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Mm.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Oh, no.
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Delayed after-eff--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Have it your way.  The point is--
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Easy, Dude.
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Huh?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude?
You know this!
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Yeah?
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
I haven't forgotten.
Nothing.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I'll show you.
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
I don't know about this, man --
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Two so far.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
I don't buy it.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
You're joking --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
What happens then?
It worked, didn't it?
And that's a good thing?
There is no cure.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Deacon brought me back.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
What?
He is an abomination!
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Get away from him!
I'll take my chances.
--which she may have--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
My eye, is there something in my eye?
--my God, Nick???
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Something was wrong.
Mrs. Leavitt--
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
I want to see the tapes.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
What'd you dream?
Then I'm going--
I can't let you in.
Fine.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Fucking owl!
How's she going to know where to--
Goes right along with these two.
--Graduate Thesis--
--about the Witch--
Fine.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Look over there.
--now there.
Asleep--
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
--it's less than four feet, just--
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Whatever.
--I know!
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
--fuck Anna!
Not this one.
Does she, goddamnit??
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
No, I--
Sort of...
I just gotta see a guy.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
You're bad.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Ray--
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
About ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Ever durned one.
What?
Uh-huh.
Yeah...
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
...What?
...What kind of fish?
Of course.
Right.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
No. not at all.
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Jeffrey.
Shit. You better tell me something.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Yes.
Sure I'm alright. 
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Please. please stay.
Frank is coming?
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Where are they?
I don't know. he moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Why not?
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You saw a lot in one night.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
See ya tomorrow.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Yeah.
Jeffrey?. Why?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Go ahead!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Good deal Dad.
What?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
What is?
You happy, baby?
We'll take it.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
What?  Yeah, sure.
It's your grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Not really, no.
Murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Oh my G-d.
But you must.  It's the only way.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Just sell it, Derek.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Coke.
In how long?  A week?
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Oh, I see.
It would be my pleasure.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Pablo said no?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I didn't mean to...
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Yeah?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
What?
Who speaks Spanish?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
Second name.
Sail.
Don't move, Hacene.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Let's try ...
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
A name?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
An inquiry into what?
Then you can go.
Any prints on the nasal spray?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Sex.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
I had bypass surgery.
Why not?
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Why does she come to you?
No.
What changed?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Three fifteen.
P.M.
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
You didn't know about it before that?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Yeah.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
No -- you're not.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
What time did you leave?
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Don't say that!
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not yet. You want to go?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
You're right -- that is sick.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
WHAT!
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
Must be nice having kids.
What's he like?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
When?
You want to go back in?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
Are you all right?
So what happened?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But no one in particular.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Do you want to leave your husband?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Yes! Hi.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Sure.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Yes, thanks.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
But now that you have it -
No. Don't do this.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Where you going?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
I don't remember!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Anywhere but here.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Wh-wh-whooo?
Those 'fools' are my people.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
And the hell everybody else, right?
Then fuck it!!!
Have you ever been inside?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
How do you know?
Why?
What else does she say?
Lucky thing.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Don't call me that.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What building?
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
Should I?
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
Here, put this in his mouth.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where's what?
Yeah, I know.
All part of the business.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Why?
The money?  The money's gone.
I need you ...
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
I had to.  You made me.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Another time.
Are you okay, Violet?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
Sure.
A beer?
Tell me about it.
He's a launderer?
Five years is a long time.
Yes, it is.
I'm already in your bed.
So am I.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
Does the case lock?
Yeah.
Sweet Jesus.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Yes.
This doesn't go upstairs.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
What do they want me to do?
Why?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
You have your passport?
Yeah, I know...
Paris?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes, I'm here...
Thanks.
Oh, Jesus... 
It's a little late for that.
You have blood on your pants.
What if I say no?
What?  Like amnesia?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
I guess so.
-- forget it --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
What about you?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
xxxxxx
Hang on... 
Where am I?
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
... have a look.
...sod you, stupid twit.
Oh, right ...
I'm waiting for my daddy.
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
What has Tuttle done?
A terrorist?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
I do. Goodbye. 
What?
Information Adjustments.
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
A heavy Christmas present.
No, really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
What?
I thought you arrested me.
Get away!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
We? Don't blame me!
Are you still following me?
Oh ... Jesus!
Would you really, Sam?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Try next of kin.
Yes.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I never signed the form.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry but ...
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Ha!!
Can you fix it?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No ...
No, no, that's impossible.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
What's his name?
What did you say?
The first is always the best.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I think this place stinks.
She should go home.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
I think I'd remember that.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Sure.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Okay.
You asked me not to come.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No, no.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
You okay?
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Frank!
What?
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Used to be my partner.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
Oh, God, no!
London.  That's a promotion!
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Why?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Call if you get weird.
Did you shoot their boots?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Aaron, will you tell me?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
People phoned in.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
You didn't say anything to her?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
No.
Almost immediately.
One's enough.
That's okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Anchor?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
They fired me.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Why so glum?
Fill for a second.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Yes.
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Were you going to you?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Well...
Because you're nuts.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
You want to come?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
You're saying stay away from him.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I just might.
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Let's see it.
Now you're a professional!
Better!
Here here...
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
What are you doing here so early?
Leonard, what are you doing?
Why not?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
You want me to open a window or something?
No...look I'm busy...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Why not?
Your work, the layers of irony.
With Dead Cat?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
If you see him.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Cheer up.  You may still.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We hate you guys!
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
I'm hungry.
Which way did she go?
What's playing there?
Don't tread on the earth?
Something like that.
Come on, what was it?
I'm here with Jenny.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
I know.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
I'm going to the senior dance.
What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm glad you came.
I forgot.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Yes.
I have to show you.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Oh, him.
We'll cover it later.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Here?
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Try to pay attention.
A what?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Oh, fuck you!
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
He knows who I am!
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Hi.
Oh.
I don't understand.
Could be.
Okay, what else?
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
He is so bald.
God, I never thought of that.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
A little better.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
No.  Please.
Aren't we all?
And now you wanta teach me?
What's so great about baseball?
It's possible.
I heard already.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed the tag!
I didn't spit on you!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
But he ain't seen my heat--
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
Naw...
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
God--what a Big League move.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Then go.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Don't try me.
We'll pray anyway.
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Okay...
Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Oh, good.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
702 472 1862.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
That's right.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Mommy.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
They payin'?
How did Nicky collect?
Four aces, Doc.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Listen...
What happened to me? What happened to you?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Yeah.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What - what, Caesar's?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
No, I'm not okay.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I - I - I...
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Why do you need that much?
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
What?
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Right.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...under?
And...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
I bought him a watch too.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Get out of here!
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You fuckin' whore!
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Oh, you are...
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
Bullshit! Bullshit!
How many kids do you have?
That's amazing.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
Ye-yeah.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Thank you.
Yeah?
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
What expenses?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Hey!
It's instinctive, you know.
Carmine left?
Artie! Artie!
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
No problem.
Ma che cazzo!
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
And how are things going down there?
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Okay.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Yes, you did.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Okay, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Yes.
Come on! 
It means I got the money.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
...they're in Penthouse K.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
They're havin' a good time too.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Fuck you!
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Denying?
All right, all right. But I - I -
Having a good time?
You have to dial nine first.
You're probably right.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
No it's not.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
What about "climbing in?"
What did you say?
Absolutely.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
You can't get away with..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
I actually got some memory back last night.
What did--?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Taking messages.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
How was I in the wrong?
Then whose is it?
Can you make him stop!
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Allow me.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
And what're you whispering for?
Who smashed the phone?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Then hang up!  Do it!
What makes you say that?
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
Tell me what she looks like.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't say that.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
What did you do?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I thought it was inspired.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
259-7881.
Ask them.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Only one way to find out.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Whatever you say.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Keep talking.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Just relax.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Call me "Nels."
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Where do I turn?
We're gonna get there first.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Doesn't everybody?
From here on, I dish it out.
So who's he?
Did he?
Hi.
Fucking men, Col --
Fuck off back to Essex!
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Bloody right I do...
He wants me to perform for him.
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
What look?
They're jealous.
Yes, please.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
No.
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
He did sometimes.
Something I heard someone say once.
Aha.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
I have to talk to her, Col --
You mean that?
I said stop it.
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
Make it up to me, then.
A little.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Only if you kiss me.
Not at all, honey.
You gonna tell me why?
You following me?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Can't remember...
Will I see you again?
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Have a look at him.
Leave me alone, Jude.
And what happens then?
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Why would you do that?
Thanks.
I told him.
I'm sure.
A hotel?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
Am I?
My pleasure.
I'm not a gambling man.
Why can't we?
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
Why?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
I didn't.
I don't know her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
I said you bastard -- stop --
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Open up.
Where's that airlines bag?
I sure am. Get it.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
I heard you, I heard you.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
No.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
Barely, yes.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
That's the spirit.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Around one.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Okay -- up there.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
That's the idea.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Why can't you be serious?
No.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Who?
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I'm afraid it is important.
And the last one?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
Not unless we're blind.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Tell me what?
I'm very cold.
I'm very confused.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Okay.
Voilà what?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Oh. I guess.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
We'll find you a hotel.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
How about once more around the park?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
What are you talking about?
Don't put yourself out.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
I don't understa--
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
You do?
I never fucked Rod.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
So?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
You never went, uh, all the way?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Can you get inside?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Really?
Mark Shale.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
You Miss Dunlop?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Pretend we're just another couple.
You can ask me anything.
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
I'm worried about someone.
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
They're tasty.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
Okay, okay.

No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Doesn't work.

...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...man!
Oh, shit.

You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!


I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.

Whoo!
 Oh...

Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...

 Yeah.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
I mean, if that gun was...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...

Put your hand in my pants.
 Come on!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.

'Course you do, Jake.
Row twenty-three, section C.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
That's too bad.
Was he right?
His girlfriend?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Ain't worth thinking about.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Curly, where's your car?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Okay.
Thank you...
I'd like to talk to him.
No?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Where?
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
How did you find out?
Why?
Did you have affairs?
Where you were when your husband died.
Then it was over the water department.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
You sure shout that?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Including the death of your husband?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Upstairs. Why?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Katherine.
Back to Mexico.
I have to go home and get my things.
Okay.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Oh, good.
Help yourself.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Si.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L.A. River?
But I have to know.
Yeah, I'll do that.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Neither do I.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ran away?
So I can have these? 
But you don't have any kids!!!
Toto, come here.
It tastes wonderful!
Come in, Alfredo.
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
No, nobody came. 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
No...
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
OK...
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Sure, sure.
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
Charles.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You're no Venus de Milo.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
No.  But you're close.
How old did you say you were?
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Half past eleven.
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Don't go, Susan.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Look out that window.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Sure.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
I know, but -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
I had a toothache.
Are you serious?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Can I join in?
No, this is great.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
I can't believe you're here.
And you said yes?
No.
But you were.
There's more, isn't there?
You lie.
Jesus, you're caustic.
Sang.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Like what?
It wasn't me.
Was it you?
With this guy locked in?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Annoying Customer.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
No, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
The Emperor.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
Wait.
Perfect dozen.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Which ones?
Why not?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Why not?
She meant nothing to you!
Broke his neck.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I never tried it.
Her fucking body fell out!
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I don't; you did.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Fuck you.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
What time did you get to work today?
Like ten after.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Jesus Christ, what next?
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
With you? I don't think so.
Nothing personal.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Hunhh? Nothing.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
Something wrong?
How many what?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
What do you mean?
He gets off on it.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Let it go...
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
That's sick, Dante.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
He didn't ask me to...
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Dental School.
All right, asshole, you're on.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
I did what I thought was right.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I know...
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Resuscitation?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
What are you doing here!?
How'd you get up here?
Of course I do.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Want me to lead?
Next time, date only basketball players.
Never
That's exactly what I want you to do.
What about you?
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
What the hell's going on?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Where's the rest of the team?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Ask the questions.
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Give me the fucking code!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Do you feel that way now?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Lice?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Big case?
You need a vacation.
Sure thing.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
You're kidding me.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I think...
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
I never bought that.
I've been calling and calling.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
Yo, whassup?
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Who the hell is this?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Oh.  Sorry.
Twenty-four minutes.
It's home.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Max?  I'm Vincent.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
So what?
I don't understand...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
No.
Oh, I'm captivated.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Makes two of us.
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Any special reason?
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
Excuse me?
Geronimo?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Mississippi?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Yes.
Six months.  Eleven days.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You're certifiable.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who?
Getting rid of my hub!
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
You don't understand --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
I want to believe you, too.
And Jonas?
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Ellie --
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Do you have a minute -- ?
How can that be?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
It's beautiful.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Because I can't.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Can you help us?
The librarian... or the library...?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Actually --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
You sonofabitch.
You too.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Did you love him?
In other words.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Yeah.
Gotta go, Arletta.
You don't know!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
What you mean, Luke?
Luke. Where you goin?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
What are you talking about?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
You already made the delivery?
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
You're calling me a crank?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
That's no surprise.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
They get fan letters...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
She on the passenger side?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Okay.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Helen... excuse me, we...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Yessir.
Helen Hudson...
What the hell you need her for?
How'd you get in on the deal?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
We were together six years, sir!
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
What!? They brought the car here?
You're not envious?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
You could get your wish at any moment.
The case could be made.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Then, you should call.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
You look beautiful.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
Will you get time off to do that?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Letty.
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Paul.
Enough with the abracadabra.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Exactly.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
And did you go to the mission?
So, it's over?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Open up.    I want to see.
I couldn't even face that one.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Bingo.
Silly, silly, silly.
It's hard to know where to start.
Forget I asked.
Can you loan me a 20?
Yes, I suppose so.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
I think I've heard this speech before.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
They don't have a murder weapon?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You'll never get out of the city.
I dunno.
Who?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
We can't.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
What for?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
What'd you get?
You haven't answered my question.
I'm from Belgium.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Fine.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Just find them!
Great fuckin' song.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Oh yeah.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
No!
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
They're not nice people.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
I didn't have the heart.
Yes.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Why do you want to teach me?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
I owe you nothing.
Long.
So what if I don't?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I'm bored.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
They forced me to marry!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Let's end this here.
Never!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
My comb!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
We followed Jade Fox.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
But the sword could be in his compound.
What do you have in mind?
Who ever made that.
Annie, I need a file.
Thanks, babe.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
It's only a flesh wound.
Who?
Mister Funboy.
I think he's yours, now.
Mom tried to cook.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
Very well, it's your ass.
18k.  Crap.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Is he inside?
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
You might say that.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You what?
From who?
No.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
At this hour? I don't think so.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
That's also none of your business.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Wait, don't hang up.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
You must take me for a real idiot.
Yes it does.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Yes.
Ben Schwarz.
I don't think that bothered him.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Do you want to learn or not?
I guess. It still sounds gross.
I... I don't think you want to know.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Is it me?
No.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Jesus!
And you think she bought it?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
I told you I don't know.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
It would feel so yummy.
Shhh.
Interesting.
No.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
She shot you down.
So what went wrong?
It was... Fantastic.
No, tell me.
Mock, mock, mock.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Is that what you think?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
I have a flair for drama.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
I accept. Now get out.
War it is.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Black.
Absolutely.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
I'll do that.
Annette! Annette!
You're a lucky guy.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
But it's already come true.
She was very pretty.
I know that.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You do that, Edward.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Yes, I did.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
But...
I don't know yet.
I've wanted a friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
That one's an elm.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, please!
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
But she's such a nice lady.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
And Amy mailed them?
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No.
It's not just in my head.
How have you been feeling?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Anything's better than Mark.
You're just saying that.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I think he called you beautiful.
I still thought it was a purse.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
He's been here all night?
What? Why'd you do that?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
So pee? Here?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
What are they for?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
No, but thanks for the warning.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
We didn't have sex.
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
No, it was our first date.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, I said it was our first date.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Tell her I'm eating.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
This one walk you home too?
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
And fifth, you're dating her.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes.  This way.
Patricia Crenshaw.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
We are...  living in their dreams...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
That's easy.  You...
And we're going away for a holiday.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Fine.
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
It's fine.
The government
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
I see what you mean.
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
This is wrong, Alan!
What do you mean?
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
You got a gun?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
`Bleed for your king.'
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
I'm outta here.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
What's wrong with a magic trick?
You made their funding disappear!
I don't know.
It's just so strange...
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
What?
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
I guess.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're doing our best, sir.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
What?
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
No wonder they're so....hungry.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Actually I don't
Don't come.
Knox?
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
What is the point?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Sort of.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
But, Chris...
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
My Word
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
YAWP!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
I'm calling her!
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
And now he will?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
I'll come to the performance.
Do you have to quit the play?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I'm not a thief.
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Right... You have a boat.
The quiet...
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
This time, make an exception.
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
A little to the left...
And what have you come up with?
A passenger...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Good... Pass the beer.
Yeah, Sal--
It's gotta!
Vince thinks... you know...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
It won't open.
Nick...
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
No, I --
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
You call me Linda, just like home.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Vince!!!
Sal's alive???
You Biederman?
Would you?
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
What?
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Playing?
Merle, I wanna go home!
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
I don't think about the shot that much.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Hunt with Vince?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
We what?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Here! This is it!
Then lemme have 'em.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Did you get one?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
The fuck I did!!!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Give it to me.
I'm not voting for you.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Not the 'T' word.
Technothugs.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm eating.
What else did he get?
I'm here.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
But he was such a good cop.
You could always take it off.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Jabez! Careful --
That's my problem, Belle.
Young man -- you got me there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And serve him right!
Why? It don't hurt.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
All right, darling.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Afraid ... of what?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Headache -- Squire?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Jabez --
I'll never get my washing done.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
I am going to lock him up.
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
What's that?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Cup for cup!
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
Mind if I play some tunes?
John.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Okay.
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Then don't waste time talking to me.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Heidi, I'm dying.
Don't call yourself fat.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah...
Where you gonna go?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Yeah... yeah!
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
You try calling the police?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
What kind of things, Leon?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Who's this?
They're okay.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Calm down, you're not ...
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Yeah ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Come on, lemme load you up...
Well, they go to guard school.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
It was on the TV.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Pure?
You shouldn't start now.
You're serious!
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
Dead or alive?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
We're not there yet.
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
You follow my car. 
Open this up!
I speak what I feel.
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Oh.  Run.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
What do you think, dumbshit?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
Yes.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Stop it.
Cunt.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Hello?
No. What's the big deal?
Something is going down. Something bad.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Nobody.
You got my back.
My brother.
My brother.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Have you noticed something about them?
So, in other words, you are not down.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What?
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Fifty cents.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Yo, I'm gone.
...peanuts.
Sorry, comb got caught.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Look at that.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Depends.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
You keep it.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Tina, it's not like that.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
That's what you think?
That's what I think.
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
Forget it, Mookie.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What?
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Well la de da.
I'm just not ready.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Is that what I think it is?
Cool.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
No no no no no.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The principal.
Wow.
Oh, is this your special place?
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Will not.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Some what?
I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
No. What happened?
A blimp.
No. Look.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
You're just jealous.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Looks like the best man won.
That's the downside. There is none.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Okay.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
What?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Oh wow. Look at you.
It's a surprise.
You got the Extender?
What papers?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
This band sounds terrible.
This is my son, Paul.
We felt his presence.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes.
Is this what you seek?
Always?
Always.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
It burns.
Stop him, Jessica!
SILENCE!
Those sounds could be imitated.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Thank you.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
The <u>women</u>?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
I don't understand.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Eddie, how was I?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
What do you mean?
This is kind of a stream--
H-how'd you know?!
It's that easy?
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Will he be okay?
Isn't he?
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
This is my way of telling you --
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
You could say that --
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, of course!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
But Greta say --
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
I just picked them up on the way over...
Bela died.
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Dynamite --
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
I'm directing.
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
Yeah. Ma...
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
What?!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
I want you to take this.
I do.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Good luck.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Mm...  Oh, man...
Who?
Al!
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Well, when will she be back?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
I hear the dog really liked him.
Why do it?
Leave. Go.
Saturday, I think we should
What?
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
I'm sorry.
Come on...
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
We're excited.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
I don't know.
No. What happened?
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Oh, Jesus.
We'd better go...
Save it.
Check forging.
What...
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
That's the point -- this could change things.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
What does that have to do with... ?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
What kind of person?
He likes it.
Do it!
What?
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
You're kidding, right?
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Right
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Hello, Tracy.
Good for you.  Good for you
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
My house.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And when did you do it?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Here?
Should we get a what?
Right now?
Sherry... I love you.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
What do you mean?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
I'm not like you.
These are private -- these are for us.
Till 19-fucking-70.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
But you did it anyway.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
So tell me about it.
Captain, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Five minutes.  That's all.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
She told you?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
I'm not asking you.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I got her address.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
What do you want to know?
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Someone must've pulled the records.
Say what and so what.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Dogs got no reason to live.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Answer yes or no.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
So be it.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
What's this all about, lad?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
It's a simple question.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
What's her name?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
I'll take your word for it.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
A sweet man.
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
What's wrong, Trash?
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
It'll be our secret.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Yes.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Who are they?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
I was a traffic analyst.
They come after you?
Looks like Detroit.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Where?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Fuckin-A.
What if--
C'mon.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Are you sure about this?
With what?
What size?
What size?
Because my life is being ruined.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About what?
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
No.
What?
I'm sorry.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
No.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
Who?
That ain't me.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
Other than me.
You're not.
Thank you.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
This conversation's over.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
You're Brill.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Mr. Dean--
Why?
Can I open 'em up?
Do I know you?
Usually they take clothes.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Jesus.
They're framing me.
You're tired.
Listen to me.
No, I--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I have a family.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
I need help.
He got hit by a bus.
Get it.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
What about the tape?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Then let's assume I don't.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
That insults them.
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
You bastard, I was believing you!
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Sorry, what's your point?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
I was talking about the girl.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Own the desert.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
When's Clifton picking you up?
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
Fine.  I'm not looking.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Off with his head!
Oh really?
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Candaules
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
I'm turning you.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Thank you.  Thank you.
That's a different dress.
Never heard of it.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
No!

I've met you before.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Yes.  Later.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
Nya-nya-nya!
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
So one day we'll meet.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
No.  He's - no.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Yessir.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
What's he saying?
No.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Yeah. Me.
Why didn't I think of that?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
It's sold.
I have a proposal for you.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
So alive.
You...you can't.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
That's my girl.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
We're only going one way.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
I've got something for you.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
You're not on the beat.
What?
The big job.
A billion dollars.
Hold the record. Alone.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Surgically attached.
It was wrong to deceive you.
I'm sorry.
They drive so recklessly there.
I'm not leaving without you.
It's never big enough.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
We're supposed to.
Suspicious, after all these years?
Check out my ball.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Probably not.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Don't use language with me --
There's more than one?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
And get someone to help around the house.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
Course I did.
So you think we got 'em scared?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You think there's more?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Not in my world.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
Yesterday.
Right.
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Whose number do you need?
You got a little girl?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
You are someone.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Mm-hm.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
What?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
I feel The Force.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Now you're making sense.
You don't look angry.
Try and control this ...
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Luke!
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
What is it?
Let's go.
What did you say?!
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
That is why you fail.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
We'll see.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Cuervo, look out behind you!
Dream on, blue eye.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
I said pull over.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
No screamin' shit.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
...I saw nothing.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
What is it my child?
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
No.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's this?
No kidding.
Phonograph.
Sure you won't change your mind?
May I ask...?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
A man to see you.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Please go away.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
About my daughter?
That depends.
I didn't get you?
Why, I don't understand?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
No, is Regan aware of it?
What?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
No.
Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
Oh, honey.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Damien Karras.
So what's wrong with her?
Withering Heights.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Uh Huh.
Bon Jour.
There's only one.
The Lord be with you.
Her heart.
Always.
From the psychiatric end.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
That's to bad.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
I could have you deported, you know that?
...Be gone!!
Give me the keys!
It's my goddamn car!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Take it now.
We don't need you, Frankie.
It's all there.  Both nights.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
My brother and I. One each.
When they coming in?
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
The hell you don't.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
It never was.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Come on, stand still.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
How about these?
Very realistic.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
No, you take the right.
Right.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
She's a big girl.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Nothing. We get nothing.
What disease?
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
What're you doing?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
We ran long.
Miss --
You find a girl?
What-?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Uh, well ...
I'll call you.
All right.  Hold on.
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
And you don't?
I suppose.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Nothing personal --
So why's he do it?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nothing.
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
He called her.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
So ... ?
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Merry Christmas.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Let me have a look.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
For being one helluva guy.
So you had a nightmare.
No.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
That's what they always say.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Don't count on it.
When did you start smoking?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
... That's great.
Call me spontaneous.
Great.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
So you left her?  Just like that?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Adelle?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
I can see that, Alan.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Who did?
Right.  That’s a major oversight...  So if I’m Kate...I can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I’m trapped in suburbia...
Ringing my bell...
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
It’s just two kids, right?
She is relentless.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Everyone needs something.
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Okay, you’re right, we’ve been dancing around this for years...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
She got those shoes...
You had a heart attack?
I want it...
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
And now...?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
What are you sure about?
It’s like a museum.
Think bigger.
For the week?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
I'd like that, too.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Victor did.
It's easy for you to be patient.
What do you mean "complete"?
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Hilarious.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
That's what we're here to find out.
Excuse me?
Are you kidding?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Yes, Cora.
And if it should take more time to get through --
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Yes...
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
What about Dr. Michaels?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Send the following message...
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Two in a row?
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Was there any damage?
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
The Wall's transparent...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Drop that fucking money!
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
We split that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
GOT IT?
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
End a April.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Mr. Mohra?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Mm.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Yah, so we're all set.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Okay.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
My patience is at an end.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Twice.
...Who they playin'?
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Ah, dammit!
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
No way.
Oh...
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, Norm.
No, that's okay.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Nope.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Thanks, hon.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
He was killed in action.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Look at my face.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
Yes?
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
I'll ask the questions, son.
You need to lighten up.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
I suppose.
Marla?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
I don't know ...
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
No, thanks.
Here.
Whatever.
When?
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
... A person.
Marla, no, wait...
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
You are an insane person.
Marla...
Don't ask.
Who's this?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Okay, everyone.
Tyler Durden.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Being clever.
This is how we fill up our lives.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
Surprise me.
What fight?
Any historical figure.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Promise you won't.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
We don't need him...
I thought you did.
I'm not asking you to.
I don't think that's true.
What?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why do people think I'm you?
Is this really news to you?
What about Marla?
I'm not going...
What?
What have you left for me?
What?
Well, sir, you said you might.
Robert Paulson?
You're welcome to join our club.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Let go of me!!
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Like what?
I'm not following you --
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
He's not a witch.
Remember the gate number?
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
In Death...
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
That's what I'm doin'!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
That's right, buddy.
Star Wars?
There's the Mekong.
Ninety.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
One hundred.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Where's your stuff?
Exactly.
No.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
I need a vacation.
Crazy motherfucker.
Spooks?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I do?
Invulnerable.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
What's the job?
Why me?
That's right.
About 22 hours on site.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
What that?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
You threw him out?
What?
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
Got any more bread crust?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
You're all right... you sure...
The moron?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
What does that mean?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
How have you been?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
You can ask.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Can I take you to lunch?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Who?
It's a classic.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Bingo!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
What are the other reasons?
I don't like horror movies!
What a gyp.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well, it's enough for me.
What are we about to do?
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You got another ball comin'.
I'm not.
Do you love me, Bobby?
I love it.
No.
Sure...
No, let's go...
Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Are you talking to us?
Don't, then.
You know who it once belonged to?
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
What?
No...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
A couple of months.
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
I don't know where she is!
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I don't believe vou.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
At game, Carl.
It's all right. I'm fine.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
Pardon me?
If you want to call it that.
Look at me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
What?
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
Just chill.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
For real?
What you want with her anyway'
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
What she look like?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
You're kidding.
What?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
What'll it be Fletch?
That a boy.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
The two surfer boys?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
That's it?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Sure you did.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Alan Stanwyk.
I want you to murder me.
So why pick me?
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Yeah.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I would, actually.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Moved out.
She moved out.
Uh, almost.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Not really.
Fletch.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Thanks, I needed that.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
All your friends call you Jazz.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
You're saying you need money.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
You're not funny.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Wha --
You gave it to the girls for one.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
What a perv...
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Did he just say what I think he said?
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Fine!
The case!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Say cheese...
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
'Bye, Johnny...
Cause if I do.
B.O.C.A.
Got a wife named Angie.
What?
Who brings it?
This side.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Pour moi?
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Willie Mays.
When ya go back on?
Morning.  Sometime.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Darling, may I have this one?
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Yeah.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
I'll go find Hayes.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
I seem nervous, huh?
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
Did he?
Sure.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I know.  He loves that thing.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Glad to hear that.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Hello?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
This afternoon?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
On the job?
Chief?!  Is that you?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Whatta we do now?
H-hi.
I'm right here, Dad.
Johnny, I know, but...
He took your wallet?
What...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Gordo?
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
I try to be.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where's Shelly?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What?
Sure.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
Don't do that to me!
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Why?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Are you all right, Shelly?
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
And, what about us?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
You're Shelly?
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Maybe.
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Great.  Just great.
Alright, alright.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Better call an ambulance first.
Happy Friday the 13th.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
My ass.
Yeah, that's fat too.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
No more.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
There's no time for this bullshit...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I'm here.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You need to leave.
So's he and he knows it.
For a good reason.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
She's yours?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I know what it sounds like.
About Jessica.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Nothing.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I don't think that's such a safe idea
I'm staying.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
I...I can't...
Just felt a little chill.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
We changed our minds.
Just radio for help, okay???
I'm not!!
Very bad today.
And he was there?
Where is it?
He'll hate it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Our Peter?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
We don't even like each other, do we?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Packs an emotional wallop.
This building is not secure.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
They're my team.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Eleventh inning. What else?
I have excellent long-term memory.
So does Elliot.
Endearing.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
It is the work of untouchables.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
Did they take your clothes?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
No.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
The fools!  Sorry...
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Have you found him?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Blood.  From the vein.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
They'll recognize me.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You may as well invite her here.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Antonio, the choir...
Why don't we say we were together?
We were just looking.
Does it have a name?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
There's a problem, Lamar.
Antonio--
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
And you got him...
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
I want to take a walk.
Where did you get them developed?
How's Estelle?
Boring.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
It's just been a while.
Sure.
Want to cry now?
I see it...
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Do it my way.
Who's she?
We keep going.
I mean it.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
I guess you're right.
No more about Beynon.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
All right. Shells?
Might try that.
Where?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Wire pull over?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
What's it to you?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
How long have you been married?
That's what matters, isn't it?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Was he?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Good evening.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Nicer than most.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
I don't know nothing.
Yes, I do.
Was he?
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Then he must have pulled her.
Have another?
Thanks for coming.
That must be interesting.
Yes.
Where would I find him?
Las Vegas.
How many?
Get knotted.
Ta-ra.
What you doing around here then?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Sod off.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
But they have to be diplomatic.
They do that up North.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Shut up.
...Polacks...
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
We're stuck with this...
It's too...
I, I...I...
...cower in his boots...
I heard that they were running cold.
The nurses?
What?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
As an idea.
Yes.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
What does that mean?
Are you sure?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Do you need five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
They're ancient.
Clear...
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
I was at home, where were you?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Did they get my contracts?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Would you excuse us, please.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
The people downtown said...
You're done, come down, and let's...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...no...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
John.  John...
...ah, fuck this...
...they kicked out.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
I don't know what you are saying.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
And did they steal the contracts...?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Guess who?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Sure.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Go ahead.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Did I...?
Yes.
To...you know.
I'm not.
If we wait till Mon...
It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.
Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They--excuse me...
The...
Some of them...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Did you like your party?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
 And he agreed?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
She's gone, Tom.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
I took care of it.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Kay, I told you...
Michael.
Get out of my hotel.
There are still things I have to do.
Not for a few years.
Except the President of the United States.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I do not.
I do not.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Yes.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
I didn't mean to...
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
What?  Oh yes.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
What was wrong?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
It's new.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
This David's a friend?
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
No.  I --
Sorry.  Not today.
Not at the moment.
You first.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Never gave it much thought.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
I see.
The Great War?
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Don't move.
You're crazy.
Did I hurt you?
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
You didn't, Jimmy.
Then who did?
That's what I'm trying to explain.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
Of course.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Of course.  This afternoon.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
You think so?  That's very kind --
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
You didn't?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
I don't golf...
You know my back.
I don't think so, Detective ...
What's that?
okay ...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Gray.
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
You, too, Ma...
oh.
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
He's in some trouble ...
Yes, sir -
I'm cool -
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Just hold-on there --
Something like that -
Yeah --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Me.
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
The era when crime didn't pay --
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
I'm cool.
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Sure, man --
A distinction worth noting ...
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
That's what I want ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
The hard part ...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
What happened to Sway?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Who's gonna do that?
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
Jimmy.
I gotta talk to you.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Watch what happens.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Okay.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
I told you "no" yesterday!
Shut the fuck up.
I have about seventy-three...
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
It's touching me.
Yeah, can I help you?
No students work for me.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
--Half-red, half-black--
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
That would be fine.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Now wait a minute--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--I'm not angry at you--
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Where're you going?
He was my roommate in college.
I don't got a crush on her.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
What?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
No.
Yeah.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Define that.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
It sure ain't good.
I used to go with the wrench.
I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
What, five?
Not a chance.
Do you keep in touch with them?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Just for fun?
Come with me to California.
I can't go out to California.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Yes, I do, Will.
I never cared about that.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
You're *ticklin' me!*
Naw. They paroled me.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Women is always tar'd.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Naw--not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
I didn't mean nothing.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Hush!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I could hide you, Tommy.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Then what, Tom?
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Whatsa matter?
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
--Stop it--
--No.
Okay. See you later.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
You see someone?
It's always the little things.
Bad experiences.
What's that?
That'd be good.
Jesus Christ!
I'll hide.
Morality.
Do you like the people you work with?
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Is that right?
Excellent. Here they come.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
In Portugal, yes.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
Whatever.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I have to get my head back into my work.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Doesn't matter.
You lived in Chicago?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Son?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Huh?
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Fine!
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
What?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
Fine!
Did he tell you that?
Don't they believe in signs here?
You already did.
Did you go riding?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Hi.
Yeah. Bye.
Tch. What are you --
The funeral's on Friday.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
What did he say?
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I'm not pretending anything!
I wish I did.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
She calls him Tommy...
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise.
- See, what you can do for him --...
You!
Diane!
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
It's never too soon to start.
I want to watch.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
I know. Amazing.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
What stuff is that?
Hack the Planet!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
The sensitive type.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
I'm gonna hit you!
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yo, hit the lights.
Yeah? Display?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
No. No one special.
Thank you!
That's bullshit.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Never heard of you. Done anything?
What's this one eat?
He's not enrolled in this class.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You're not gonna win.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
We caught 'em.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Hey, it's me.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
I'm not angry it's just
We've been better.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Brady!
Go!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
We should call the fire department.
I'm not calling the fire department.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
Check him out.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Drive Carefully.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
I can't sleep.
I don't want to.
It was the nightmare man
Yeah, hurry up.
I thought you said you were ready.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Then we'll be safe?
No.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Thanks.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Are you sure?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Could have...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I don't think so...
I don't like that story.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
No...
I'm scared...
How?
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
I see.
It means... I see.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Mm-mm!
A lot of works.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
And you, you-you're going?
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
We're actresses.
What time do you get off?
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
This time I really think I have something.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
And it's just in one ear?
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Ed Smythe, yes.
...cannot go on the air.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
No!  No...
No, I don't think so.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I didn't sleep all night.
Is something wrong?
I didn't say that.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Oh, honey!
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mmm...
Mm-hm.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Jesus...Jesus!
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Why?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Yeah.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I know, I know.
Isn't that great?
Oh!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
He's such a loser!
Well, how about this?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
...namely a personality.
No, I am.  I am.
No, the reason I ask is--
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
I'm pregnant.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...I was <u>working</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
What have they got you doing?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
...very good.
Now, whyn't you help us?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
What's new onna street?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...nightmare.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...what a world.
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
No, no, of course not.
....what...? 
'fraid it's too late.
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Give it up.
You know it?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
How could you know?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes.... yes...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Fine, thank you, but
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
...what do you expect me to...
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Dottore Fanelli...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
....that's right.
Then what brings you back?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
...why?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Did you wait until you were 18?
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Your Secret admirer?
That wants to be a Yes.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Yeah. I guess I do.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Don't worry, you...
Do you really think I care?
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh, I didn't tell you. I wear this                          ] all year round. The chicks dig it...                        ]
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Shoot.
It's not my style, okay?
Gee, thanks.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Like last night, Veronica?
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
What do you want from me?
Yeah, maybe.
No.
Give it up girl!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Suicide is a private thing.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
You're not funny.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did not.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
This knife is filthy.
Let's kick his ass.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
But my name's not...
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Is it hurting, dear?
breaks down into heavy sobs.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Love, you can still write to each other.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
Saint Mario!
He . . .
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
Well?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
What?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
But... I thought...
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Ambulance.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Try stupid.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante...
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
Read it.  It'll be fine.
You do?
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Helluva story!
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
You didn't?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
Safety?
How are they with kids?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Who doesn't?
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
I think we should talk first.
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
Holly -- that's not so.
He'll never appreciate it more.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
Stop knowing me so well.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Where should I hide the car keys?
C'mon.
What?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
This is my house.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Just reduced.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
What for, dickweed?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Can we keep him?
No.
Even better.
Really.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
They appear to be authentic.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
What?
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.
Most people are afraid of death.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Yes.
As friends -- always as friends.
No -- I will.
How?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
A lucky guess.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
Sorry.
Why not?
I've seen it.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
And the other one -- he is like you?
I don't know.
Yes.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I'm going to my desk.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Like what?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
What?
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
You'd better be kidding.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I know.
Stop it.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Just one question.  Please.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
A delegation.
I'll be back.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
What was the response?
I don't understand.
I can't, I don't have the men.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
The front gate would be best, General.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Oh my God!
You’re drunk.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I will see what I can do.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Give him time.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Why?
Please do not talk like this.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Can I help you?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
Not yet.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Left, goddamnit!
The...Fourth of July.
-- yeah, we did that --
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
You need to get out more.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- that's the fact, bud --
That's crazy!
He's gotta still be down here.
For chrissake give me a hand!
What --
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Really? Well, let it rip.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
And then what happens?
Maybe if I --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
What?
I am.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
It works.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
For the love of God....please...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Why don't you pass me your plate?
No!
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
Good-bye.
She talks to me.
Ok...
Go to your room!  Now!
She's hiding.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Ok...
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
Yes, I am.
Did you know her very well?
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Your apartment.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
What is it?
I'm trying to quit.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
No.  We want ...
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
I don't know.  Maybe.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Not quite.
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Too-do-loo, babe.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
How long were you in?
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
Oh.  No.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Wha.....
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Baseball, why?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Yes.
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Sharp.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Yeah.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Muncie!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Please! Norville!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
...Why don't I just type this up...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
I know that, Amy.
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Never mind about that...
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Well, I --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, but, buddy --
Get up!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
I --
You --
Hmmm.
Well... I'm for it...
Ya don't say.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
The mark notices.
Thank you for waking me.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Where?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
You don't believe in it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Good morning.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Help me? How?
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
What about her?
Why?
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Elena.
Rough day. Good night.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
I have no idea.
What do you mean?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Fine.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Gotcha.
Right. Gotcha.
What are you talking about?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
With Mikey?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Social work?
How'd you know?
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I gotta get to English class.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
The Idiot.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah?
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
I dunno. I --
Huh?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Charles, what time is it?
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah.
You never tasted the stuff?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Sure.
Who's playing?
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
How much closer would you say you were?
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
I know.
Anything.  It's important.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
And something else that might interest you.
What happened at that signing?
Seven years.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
You know I remember that.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm not expecting anyone.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Thought you wanted something fun...
What was?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
If you want it to be...
You're not following procedure.
Who made us what we are?
No.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Stop her Louis!
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Claudia - don't -
Yes...
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You really believe that?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
But if she dies...
You want death? Is it death you want?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want a woman.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I don't?
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
But how do you know?
Paris? You came from Paris?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
NO!!!
What are you saying?
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
Yes!
Is that bad?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Yeah.
Will you try...for me, please?
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
Ben Willis.
You sure?
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
How's Julie?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Crowded.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
No.  She shall not be left here.
Whet do you mean?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
How did she die?
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
No, of course not.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Who is it?
What's that book you've got there?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I know that girl!
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Well, what happened to you?
Uh-huh.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Well then, how do you know?
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Have a good time, son.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Say, where's Mother?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hello, Violet.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
This way.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Okay –– what can we lose?
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Where'd you get that dress?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
Please, let's not stop, George.
Left them at the office.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Sure, sure I am.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
Someone pop your balloon?
Is she responsible for the punch?
No.
That's awful.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Over here!
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
Positive I.D.?
Oh.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Right.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
You said something about a camera.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
All of us thank you, okay?
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?
What shark?
Do you?
Okay, so that's it.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
And sound.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
As far as the office.
Better yet.
It's good with coffee.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Maybe they are!
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Hiya yourself.
Now I really want to see it.
Shh.  Shhh....
Help!  Help!
Me neither.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
I can't stop thinking!
Nope.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
What the hell is it?
Great.  I got some wine.
What about me?
Not tonight.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
Yeah.
Would you take him?
What the hell is he doing?
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
How many sharks have you killed?
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
I talked you into this?
Are you coming...?
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Bracelets.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Sure.  Let's go.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
So tell Calvin.
Yes, you can.
Michael, you're not going down there.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Philip.
And here I thought I was charming you.
How'd it get in here?!
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Can't help it... ahh...
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Oh...
Reach for the limit I always say.
Always do.
It's not closing, Mike.
Look great, don't I?
Sharks???
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Who's grown up?
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Don't bother Hoagie....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
He told me you both did....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
No....
I have work....
What's wrong?  What happened?
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Henny Youngman....
You make sure they come?
You have something to say about everything....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
He knows what he has to do....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I didn't.
Good.  So will I....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Why'd you come out here?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
No one does till they learn....
It's wonderful....
I like to travel....
What?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You're the man who drives the plane.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Get her started....
Inch by inch....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I signed on....
So did I....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
Just trying to be helpful....
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
It'll work....
Who grows more beautiful....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Oh no--
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Listen to me saying what?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
He ain't offerin me shit.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
My hands?
Yes.
I don't know.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Have you known her long?
How d'you know what I'm like?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Why?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
No, Sir.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Jerry!  Do something --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I have to finish my job --
No.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh tsht. Yes.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
What?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Okay... I will...
What --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Thank you.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Good.
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Said who?  Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Why not?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
How do I know?
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Damn right.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Damn right.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
You said "fuck".
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
What's a bad idea?
So do you.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
What did you say?
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
I would completely support that.
Here!
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
He loves you too.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Sure.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
NO!
Really?  What do you do there?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Then we go home?
I want to be an astronaut.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
You're right.
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
John . . .
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
My vacation is over in a week.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Where does it say that?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
No way.
Look!  Sarah!
Why did you come here?
I'm her father.
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Oh, no!
I'm trying!
You're sure we have to?
The door security systems are shutting down.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
What now?
Where did the vehicles stop?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
The - - agility.  You're right!
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
Like hell it is!
It's anti-nature.
Anti-nature.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Yeah, they hate me.
I didn't say I was scared.
What kind of opinions?
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
Yes.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
That's not true...
Great.
What about that other guy?
Fuck you.
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
None of that's true?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
I read the one about the penal colony.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Yes.
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
Yes.
You're detestable.
I usually take lunch by the River.
-- Eduard --
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
... All right.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Why were you given notice?
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
I wouldn't put it past him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I -- I found your jailer.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Was he depressed?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
... Just a perception.
I'll bear that in mind.
What did she say?
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
... A piece of paper ...
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I photographed it extensively, father.
No!
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
Native costume?
That's too bad.
What was it, Jack?
You better not slow us down, Denham!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
What's that?
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
I do not love him.
Sorry. 
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Didn't want you.
No, that's not --
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK?
No thanks.
What do you think?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
What're you gonna do next?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
No, I said what did you think.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Not much point to this, is there?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
My bed.
I was wondering what that was.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
It's in the report.
All right.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Yes?
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
Detroit.
What about your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
I guess...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
We use the green and yellow.
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
Right.
Sure.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Then I have concluded my questions.
And what is your present salary?
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
No.
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
I don't know...
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
You've been living here, in the city?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Beautiful.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
I don't believe you.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, don't be so hostile.
No.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Sure.
What?
Yes. I am ready.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
I have a copy for you.
It is calm.
All?
Yes.
Answer. 
Do you have money?
Please.
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
I will not go.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Good day.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Always.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You decide.
Does he have the spot?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I would not know. Maybe.
Ahh.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
No, Holiness.
I will miss you.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
We have.
It may not be your decision to make.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Hmm.
Too young?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Go ahead.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
You do?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just forget it.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thank you.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
Alright, Jack!
We might as well pack.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Obviously I was wrong!
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
And this is how he came to the boat?
It's just that--
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
What the hell?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
What is this?
Look.
I guess.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Backstabber?
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Well, except for the one girl.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Yes sir.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
And what is that, sir?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Sometimes you do.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Then please - do this test for me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
A cattle ranch?
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
Then tell me how.
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Maybe...
I sent three men to Webb!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Ottawa!
Excuse me...
That is sedition! Treason!
I don't understand!
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
: Only one or two loads.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
That's all, sir.
You forget yourself!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Atten-hut!
Yes.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Yeah...right...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Good...It's going good.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
And it killed Bo?
Do it.
How's TransOcean doing?
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Hook's on 24...
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sixpack...
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
And Tom took care of them.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Good job, Chris.
Jesus Christ!
About twenty minutes.
Is that you, Dean?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
Furry muff, let's go.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
What the fuck is going on?
Plank?
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
I mean it's fucking empty.
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I'll only be a minute.
And?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
Lives and learns doesn't one.
What are you doing, Plank?
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
And that does include the amp?
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
My van is half full.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
And what did she do?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
I do, sir.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
And you and Private Graves--
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Yeah.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You were in a fight--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
What?
So that's him--
Both.
So they stayed in Florida?
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
So you're going into the Army?
You wouldn't?
No.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Seriously.
We been through this before--
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Eladio Cruz.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."
He was a unique individual.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Do you?
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
That's me.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
You gonna stay out here?
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
I'll see what's going on.
So she tells me three times a week.
People liked him.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
How come it feels the same?
Two years.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Uh-huh.
They got telephones.
You don't need to cuff me.
Yeah. It's quiet--
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Yeah.  It's French.
You heard right.
Isn't that French for something?
Why would I do that?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Not yet.
Be ready.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
That's my business. Harry.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
Harry-?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
--vanished.
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
What are you, my mother?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Are you a gambling man?
Are you sure?
No.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
The Puritan?
For what?
Is that all?
And you're not?
Is that all?
Fuck.
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
Fuck you.
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yeah, they told me.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Ok.
OK, see you downstairs.
No, its easy.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't know.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
And marriage, does that get easier?
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Yeah, look at that thing.
No, we'll find something around here.
Thanks.
Hello, darling.
Bob?
Fine.
Ok.
Hospital?
One moment.
Sure.
Ok.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Just me.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
Well I know he's come here before.
And also that...
I do.
I had to.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
Nice suit.
We millionaires yet?
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
What happened?
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Watch your mouth.
Engaged.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
That's ridiculous.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You're a caterer?
Thanks.
Shh.  It's okay.
It's okay.
To do what you love.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
And he's fine, girl.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
They ever love you back?
What?
I know.  But chances are...
Didn't have to try very hard.
But?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I just can.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Kay.
For how long?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
And?
Guess not.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
You sure?
You do see me standing here, right?
Fine, Quincy.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Not really.
Nah.  I have curfew.
What the hell's going on?
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
A rest?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
For what?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Well, can you give him this for me?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Still the man.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Why not?
You work too hard, Pop.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
What mess?
What?
I just told you.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
Lucky kid.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yeah, but I don't know --
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
You wanna go on a date with me?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Well I don't go out very much.
ok.
...yeah...
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
You don't know how crazy I am.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Ready to go,go,go?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Have you ever been there?
Sure, why?
Son, don't --
DAD --
Sorry, little man.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
No Can Do.
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Is it real love?
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
That's right.
Shall we drink to that?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Your teeth are fine.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
He has Phil right now.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Let's talk about --
-- let's talk more about your background --
It's all important --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
I wouldn'tve asked --
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Mmm.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
There's no disturbance.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I AM CALM.
I live alone.
Ok. What's your name?
I preffer to stand.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Been drinkin' today?
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Yes.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
I'll answer anything.
Yes.
Just once.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Shut the fuck up.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Bottled Water?
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's pretty cool.
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I need this one.
Love you too.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I hate it.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
About to hang himself, I should think.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Come on...
Who does?
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
To kill the king.
What is that?
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Whose rooms are those?
Just... water.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
I am unhurt --
Thank you, Keeper.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
... Nothing.
Raoul... is in love...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Cooperate?
You set to go -
Great. Well that changes a lot...
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Where up north?
Only on dates?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Where the hell is my car?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Yeah...
Jesus, man...
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Both at the same bank...
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Somebody hurt him?
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You look all right now.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
I won't be here.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There's no connection between the families.
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I'm fine.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
I don't know...
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
Not me.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Absolutely,
Yeah. It's right here.
Where did you get it?!
She'll be in, in the morning...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's right-handed.
He's misunderstood.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What happened to them?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I love you...
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Mama was probably asleep.
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
You got a deal...
I can't thank you enough, I...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
And Hobbs died?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Yes.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Yes.
They're asking for it.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Bob Gorsky.
Oh shit.
Should Tank I.D. it?
I don't know... My computer...
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
An accident?!
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Goddamnit!
Go.
They'll be able to track it.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
This can't be...
You've never used them before.
Wild, isn't it?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Yes.
He is the One.  He is the One!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
No.
She told me...
What choice?
What?
No, you're not.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Do what?
It wasn't fast enough.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
I don't know.  I lost him.
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Panther!  Same thing...
Should I slap him?
Didn't show up.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
That's not going to help.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Yeah, where's the rest?
Hostess?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Did you?
No.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Sure...He lives there?
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Come on.
You mean it's heisted.
Friends of yours Michael.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
You think so?
Have you got a minute?
And you could care less --
Annie made them.
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
And that?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
He'll wait --
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
It's going to be great --
Sit down, Drew.
How nice for you both.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
What are their feelings?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Yeah.  Neat.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Make it time.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Yes?
As long as it takes.
What do you mean 'free'?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Be sorry for nothing.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
And I appreciate you, too.
I said get out.
Why, yes.  Thank you.
How beautiful.
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
'Threw' you?  Where?
I won't.
No --
Yes?
I understand.
Are you sad, Bill?
Oh.  Okay.
Okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
Thank you.
'...Yes --'
I do?  How long will you be staying?
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Of course.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Thank you, Quince.
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Yeah, I give a shit.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
How did you know?
You like him, don't you?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
I don't understand.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Where's he going?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
I'm having a helluva time.
Daddy --
You and 'Honey'?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
'Her'.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
No, it was so right it scares me.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
What's it like?
Seen you together, that's all.
Why?
Yeah?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
So I just take your word?
Somebody's come. Already.
Did you?
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Why not?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Then why are you here?
Lenny, is that you?
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Prove it.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
From who?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Why would I do that?						    *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
And...?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
You can't.
Make it 40%.
You do.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
She's dead...
...and therafore there is no consequence?
What do you mean?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Something's wrong.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Nothing.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Verdado where?
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Switek?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
What flowers?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
The Statue of Liberty.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Yeah?
You sure are a pretty lady.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Whatsa matter now?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Get down -- where?
Get lost.
Where?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
How much?
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
Just what?
A hundred grams.
Seven years...
Hello.
What do you mean?
Yeah!
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
It's already been cut.
What?
Oh shit.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Mr. Yesil.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Right.
The Department of Public Health...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Depends.  You got a memo?
What do you-?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Across both tracks!!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
No...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Please.
I'll be late.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Peter-
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
It has no nobility.
It's fine.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I DIDN'T...
Yes.
Yes.
It'll only take a second.
--cliff-hangers--
...have to wait.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Be my guest.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
What?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Newspapers?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
How grateful?
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
More like two-two point two million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So do I.  Sort of.
That's because I'm on my back.
Something like that.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Oh Ethan!..
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Not necessarily.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
And then what?
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I do.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Yep.
Left jacket pocket?
They'll kill me.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
But why tell us?
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
May take a little time.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I'm going to answer it.
Whoís dead?
Yeah.  I follow you.
Who else is left?
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Very good.
What was your deal with Job?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I wouldn't dream of it.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
What about Job?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
In Langley.
We'll see.
We're not outta here yet.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
He's our guy.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Bed.
I'm getting married.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Maybe.
And what did they say?
Good morning, Lucy.
You have too many dogs.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
How'd he die?
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
You really are stupid, you know that.
I'm telling you your life!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I was dead, too.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Loretta.
I've got you.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
Take it easy.
You don't get along with anybody!
Oh no I didn't!
I'm in love with you!
I'm afraid of who I am.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
She was too young for him.
I shouldn't.
What?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
How was your plane ride?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
What sins have you to confess?
Alright.
I don't know.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
It was a miracle!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
That woman was a student of yours?
Don't shit where you eat.
I guess you can't invite me in?
What? What?
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
The Britons.
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
No, no ... not "is"!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I've had worse.
Come on you pansy!
Come on then.
I'll have your leg.
Come, Patsy.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who ... Who breaks out?
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  No.  No!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
There.
Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Blue.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
I don't know that!
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Herbert.
I'm ... your son ...
How?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
No.  It's unhealthy.
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
I'm getting dressed.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
It's so infernally cold in here.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
This is a slur on her good name.
Quite.
Was there never ambition?
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Ma'am.
I'm glad of it.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
I do not accept.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Who?
No, she wasn't.
Read it!
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Ma'am.
How do you do that?
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It is.
You imagined it.
She thought Benz was at school.
Laurie's.
We can't...
Like the fractals?
What?
I can't believe you made it!
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
... What??
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I ...
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Are you okay?
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
But you won't.
Was anyone hurt?
But it said #12.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Betty Elms.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Right then.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
No...
No time. Get him up.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
We drown.
Is this really the time ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Fine...
Great...
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Don't eat at the console.
But, he's...
Trust is earned not given away.
I just want to double check the facts.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Fire the whole division.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I am thirty two.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Better, sir.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I was.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
What ?????
I meant him.
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Shut up ! It's me.
What ?
Where are we ?
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
This is California, anything is possible.
I don't think you're very polite.
You want me to move?
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Give my love to Shelly.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
How about a nice glass of milk?
No.
What're you saying?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Owh...
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
What's it for?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Something wrong?
Sort of?
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
You leave your father to me.
I know, look at his little hands.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
They're dead?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Goodnight Shelly.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
The money?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Do you miss her?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Sure.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
We'd love to hear it.
Does he love her?
I am.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Uh huh.
Okay.
Have you ever tried any?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Who's that with your Dad?
What?
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
You're right, let's knock it down.
Really?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
I do, she's real funny.
Like they do on TV?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
I should look different.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
I have a suggestion...
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
To belong to someone.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
He said that, too.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
A trademark move, don't touch it.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
I was gonna predict that.
Don't you see...
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
It doesn't say th...
I need you.
Waiter! Check, please!
Firenze.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Boy, those were the days.
Like I said, dazzling.
Have you.
Except for that.
The night we met.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
It means a lot.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
I came here, looking for her.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
An so it is.
Right here.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
I won first prize.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Oh, sure.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Minimum.
She's in Paris.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Who's that?
How do you know?
Get in.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
How do you know if they do?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
What?
I have to go. He sighs.
Oh.
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
How much?
What!
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Come on.
Oh --
I'll be dammed.
I see.
Yes you are.
Yes, they were.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Are we in a big hurry?
You got something you want to do?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Thank you, sir.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
I can appreciate that.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
By all means.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
Wagons, hooaaa!
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She sings? What does she sing?
Was what worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
No.
Got it.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
We are.  Your camera.
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here.
Take a wild stab!
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Rockin'!
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah, sure.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
How so?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Lose 'em.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
They done that too long in my family.
Come on, honey.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
Hell, you got steady work.
That's right.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Well, he worked around.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You work around town?
That's right.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Go on - you can have one!
That's right.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'll see you later.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Well, that'll be the first time.
Take it easy, Frankie.
Wouldn't have known you.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
He's my son!
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Shut up, Will.
Like hell you ain't!
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
Don't play with me.
The Elders, mon...
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
No, but it traced me.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Linked?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
What are you talking about?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
The words?
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We run. You crack the pattern?
How long, Dixie?
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
I don't know. I don't know...
And Linda...
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Go ahead...
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
On a good run... yeah.
A regular Fagan.
What went down between you and Riviera?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What are you talking about?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Petty good.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
That is lingerie.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Why?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
Little known fact.
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
I know.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
That's what I'm saying.
Nah uh.
We went through the door...
Yes.
Why not?
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
Specifically.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
You got a problem with me, Grady?
What are you doing here?
I know.
Who?
About what?
What is it?
I'm not hungry.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Sure...go ahead.
All of them.
We're going to bed.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Thanks, Max.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
It's been a long time.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
Anything?
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
How do we get in?
A sad choice.
Mary Helena.
Cooling down.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I won't allow it.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Well... a shot at it.
Oh, stop showing off.
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Really?
No thanks.
Coffee?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Busy tomorrow?
Ahm...
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
I think goodbye is traditional.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
With a goat playing a violin.
What?
You and every person in this country.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
The movie star?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
Is it someone we know?
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
How about Miss Flintstone?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Mister Sefelt?
Tell us about it...
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
'K-k-kay, Mack!
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
God Bless America.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sure, Mack...
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
My feet hurt...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I said out!
I just started!
You can come back later!
No!
I'm not running a charity ward...
Who told you that?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Hold it a minute.
He is!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
In what way?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
I don't, Doc...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
I'm afraid not.
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay!
Shhh!
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Shhh!  This way!
To help you relax... please...
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Thank you.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Evenin', ma'am.
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Yes.
You're sure...
Let's find a telephone.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Except possibly that.
Ha un numero di telefono?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Amazing.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That was before I found out what it was.
You are leaving, aren't you?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
So it wasn't real.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Or Hustler.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
We were hungry.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
I can't believe you did that!
I would call it-- unforgivable.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
There is no us.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Tonight?
Any night.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I know.  You're right.
What about your job?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
Right.  My brother.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
No one's perfect, Kate.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Larry, did you rent a car?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni.
Huh?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
You said it differently then.
She's not here.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
That was the idea.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Terry... Terry... .
They play pretty rough.
I better get home.
Man, you were a mess!
How would you've done it?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
I don't know.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
You haven't finished your beer.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
You?
I just told the Father.
You... .
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
My pigeons... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
You are like—
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
About Edie?
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Nice fellows.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
What?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Such as what?
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Aw, Johnny... .
Now just a minute, I—
You want to know somethin'—?
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Then..then what's that music?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
...And I thought you loved me.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
It would seem so, Master
When!?
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
You mean...!
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You know better than that.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
And the one driving the other car?
Tell me, how do you do that?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Why don't we talk about it later?
She's coming with us.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
I get that feeling, yeah.
Shit.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
It was an unusual experience.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
What do you want to bet?
You don't, huh?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
I bet.  How much?
I wasn't asking permission.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
You don't act like it.
Sure.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
You have to be kidding.
Yeah...
Really.
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Love it.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
How far do we go with this?
Yeah, but in a nice way.
He killed a police officer.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
In the trunk?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
You know who they are?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
It's a big house.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Five point two.
The flight?
She did, huh.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Uh-huh.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Here?  In this house?
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
Not at all.
I didn't have time.
Foley's got it.
Red...Strange?
That's me, Sir.
Yes Sir.
You liked that?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
What the hell happened to you guys?
You guys are new?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
What facts are those?
Six P-40's.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Thank you, Sir.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
How did you?...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
It must of been a convincing letter.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
Good—bye, Grandma.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Would you?
Charlie, how are you?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
How'd you know about that?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What?
That would be impossible.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
For what?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Am I dead or not?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Yes... why?
Sure.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
He was dead. You know he was.
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Allright. Calm down.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I promise!
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
What's that mean?!
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Your... lover?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha. Very nice.
What kind of person is that?
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
I suppose you could say that.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
I'm fine.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
That's correct.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Not especially.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Yes, we did.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
He was doing a great job.
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Show me your eyes.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Think about what?
One or two.
Audrey?
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Don't do this to me....
It's starting....
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
We just keep him locked up forever?
What?
So why isn't it all bloody?
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
60 years ago.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
79 kilos.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
You know who Muhammad was?
Frightening thought.
Riddick?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
No. She's not.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Just the same, I want one.
Right now, if you like.
No.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
You didn't think so then.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Geiger counter?
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
I'll see.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
I don't know.
Okay.Up to the cave.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
This is his assertion.
Where are they now?
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
You lame or something?
I got one...
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
I volunteered.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
He dugged his own grave.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Vancouver, B.C.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Immigration Officer?
Possibly, Miss.
Bank?
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
There's one less tonight.
He got in here how?
How did you meet him?
There wasn't any plane.
Is this the best you can do?
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Beer?  Well, all right.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
We wouldn't have met at all.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
You understand perfectly.
What does he see?
They call me Jeff.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
All right. Get him.
This way.
A private joke.
If I can get off.
Yes, I've seen it before.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
That must hurt.
Information.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Passkey?
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
Thank you.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
I've met her.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
You can find out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I don't understand.
He checks too.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Why should I mind?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
What does it look like?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Be nasty.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
I see.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
Freshman and sophomores...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
What did he want?
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
Let me see.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Thanks.
They don't count.
I'm not here.
That's good.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Yes.
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
My man!
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Caught my first tube this morning.
That's the point, isn't it?
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Got it.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Like the old days, Dillon.
Well somebody sent them.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
I talked to some developers about the land.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
So do day jobs.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
I sell them.
Not... quite.
Did you buy some clothes?
Any good?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Please.
Dinner can wait.
What id we run into someone I know?
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
But don't they have it in English?
Did you?
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
I know a lot of nice girls.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Have you lost your mind?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Go for the bucks.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
I... Edward...
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
They will serve salad.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I don't think it would fit you.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
With pride. What can I do for you?
As you wish.
But what if something happens to you?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
It's you.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
I hope we win...
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
-- well, when does it get good?
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
As you wish...
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
I thought he was with you.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I must know.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Oh, have it your way.
I smell nothing.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Have fun storming the castle.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Congratulations.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Maybe you're happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Yes.
We swear it!
Good.  I will make the preparations.
But he has long hair!
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Very nice girl.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
We can't... we keep our money there!
Send for Goebbels.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
No! Of all...
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
And when she left, she never came back.
I live there. Alone.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Casharoonie!
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
How much?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Is Mary here?
What's the matter?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
No.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Yes.
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Sam, I'm going.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Without calling me?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
She always tries to be proper.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Why not?
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sam. This is the last time.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
No.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Phoenix?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I didn't think so.
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Indeed, he has often told me.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
I don't know--I can't tell--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
No!  Good night!
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
Did you? Where?
Why didn't you eat last night?
Well, I do say it.
So that's the way it is?
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
I'd love to.
The body of Joan Gale!
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Now don't that call for an extra!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
How's every little thing?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Fire insurance!
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Dad...
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Nobody.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
You won't die, Rose.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
I do, too.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I think Daddy suspects.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
I'm not blubbering.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
She will succeed.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
No, sir.
I'm not hungry.
Yes, sir.
Well. What kinda job is it?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I had better call Daddy.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
Lay off once, would you?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Name one.
Entertainers don't count.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Bullshit.
Oh... okay.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
We've got the tape to prove it.
You going rogue on me?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Beholden to none.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't see.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Fine. Together again, huh?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Here goes nothing.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I've got something to say.
Oh Brad.
For you.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
No, don't do that.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Want to come again and stay
Smile and that will mean I may
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh, lucky him.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
What?
Could ya take off that hat.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Yeah...
Paulie!
Only a pig would say that!
Owe you what?
What?!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
...This man.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Move your shoulders down.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
I agree.
Creed is down!!!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
How'd you know?
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Excuse me.
Stuff it, man!
...What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
More like thirty.
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
'Bout an hour ago.
...I said that before.
How do you mean?
What's happened is freak luck.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
...What?
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Yo, Benny.
Would you keep goin'?
Great, kid, great.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
It don't matter.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
I got whiskey here.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
He's right here in the...
That's what you woke me up for?
What a gasser.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
So what do you want me to do?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Aren't you the lucky one...
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Safe?
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Forget it.
I rest my case.
Yeah?
Good idea.
From this box here...
In love?
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Speakest thou from thy heart?
What?
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
You kiss by the book.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
I am for you.
Is that right?
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
I thought I did.
That's right.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Bloody fucking hell...
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Shut up!
Bad company...
In here...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
You'll die if you leave here.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Really?
And you respect him.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Who else would you be?
Coordinate what?
As in, they own it?
I do.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
A lot of people died.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Thorough man.
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
What?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
I'm sure.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
The Russian would be easier.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the right thing to do.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
And how do you figure we do that?
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I know.
Nothing happened?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah...see you at three.
Dwayne -
Calm down --
I think I am.
We're gonna talk.
At least around here it does.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
This is your ship?
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
That's right.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
Who died?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Forget it.
IT IS CRAZY!
You said --
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
Excuse me?
What is it?
Fine with me.
No mu-shu.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Who's Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Excuse me?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
They asked for the best street man I had.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
What plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
No. I just made it up.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Good God, ya'll!
What do you hear?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
No...what?
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
You a cop or something?
She's fine.
You have what I asked for?
I do.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
After I left?
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
And what did you say?
Good one!  Thanks.
God bless you, Maggie.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
No.  No, you didn't.
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Oh, please!
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Oh, I will.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Excuse me?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
A little longer for me.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yup!
Why?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Okay.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
No.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
And then I'll see you in New York --
You couldn't.
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
What was what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Right.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Yes.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
M.F.E.O.?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
We'll move them --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
Hello.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Right.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Somewhere in the middle.
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
Jed's got cables.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Like do you believe in heaven?
Oh, right.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
That's true.  Why is that?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.  Sam?
You must be Jonah.
I'm sorry --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
He's good at it.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
There's nothing stopping you.
You want 'em all arrested?
It never ends.
Yeah.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Aaah, what's the use?
No, no ...
You are no good to me -- in jail.
I'm going back tomorrow.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
A meeting?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
What attitude?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
No.
Shhh.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

Who wouldn't?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Nothing.
Why not?
Because he'll kill me.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Never heard of him.
And you admire that?
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
Find a new job.
Ass first into the world.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Don't get carried away.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
No. I'm good.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Jesus.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
The Mexicali Boys
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
There's no motels around here.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Now that's scary!
Don't worry about it.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
A half-track, anything.
It was nothing.
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Same place we are.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
I'll be alright.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
See to it.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
That's right.
For going to school?
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Please?
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
So, what's your point?
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Crash paranoia.
Okay, I give up.
You should be.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
That's right, work it out.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Alright.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Are you busy on Friday?
So you're monumentally busy?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
So it's an honor?
That's cool then.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
Why didn't you tell me?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Yeah you do.
Is this because of your dad?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I know.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
Yeah.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I don't know.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you man.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Oskar, please -
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
Yeah, what's that?
I pay you too much.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know.  Soon.
Look -
You did, but you didn't.
This is not my problem.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Ah, yes.
Oskar -
And killing.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
No, no, what, what is it?
No.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
What now?
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
Hang up...call...
That's okay.
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
But you’ll never get away with it.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
Good question. You took the bait.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Until now.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Tails.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
We'd break some furniture.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
No, wait...
Oh my God.
I'd really just like to be alone.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Do you work for her now?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
More of a game really.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Oh yeah, how?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
The killer called her.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
No.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
And?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
I am Gale Weathers!
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It's Sarah.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
Sorry.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Yes, sir.
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
It's been a year since she died.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Who are you trying to reach?
It happens. Take it easy.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
You're making popcorn?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
What do you think I said?
No-bored.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Then he dies. Right now.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Shit.
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
...yeah...
And my Dad? Any word on him?
He's her boyfriend.
How is she?
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Can you knock?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
The why'd the police let him go?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
I can cry on cue.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
The official term is "psychotic".
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I bet he's pissed.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
TATUM!
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Announcing what?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Hello.
David... please...
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You should be thanking me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
No.
I wish I still thought like you.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Don't do this... please...
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't sleep very well.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
By what you preach...none!
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Whatchu doin'?...
Never heard of him...
Not likely.
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Over there!
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
It wasn't much of a letter...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
You?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
You don't remember?
But what is the truth?
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
No, your marriage bed.
As soon as I have found my muse
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
To my weekly confession.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
I did not.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Mercutio…good name.
A different one you haven't written?
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
I will.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Is she obedient?
Who is there?
Oh--I am him too!
Well perhaps better than my first. 
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
I don't know. It's a mystery
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
My hat?
I . . .
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
And break her heart and mine?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
But what of Lord Wessex?
A man, my lord?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
Serve.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
No, not that.
I won't be able to.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
Not eating what?
They know.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
What?
Parked outside?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Cameron?
Really?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Alex.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
All right. No problem.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Who was it?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Oh.
I'll wait there.
Don't you ever stop?
Let him go. Let him take it all.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
No.
No one.
If I think you're lying --
I'm boring?
That guy, the one that died.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
No.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
Yes, but... I thought...
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to see you anymore.
But you don't know what happened.
Calm down, baby.
Yes.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
Nobody can hear it.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Gee, this is great.
I asked you first.
Why?
No shit.
And you need money?
They are?
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Yeah, I think so...
Yeah... I mean great.
Did I what?
-- we can't now.
No you didn't.
You were great.
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
Nothing.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
I'm busy, man.
What with?
-- Oh my yes.
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
Not yet.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Here in the canyon.
Keep moving --
But in the same house, you know, one house.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Egypt!
Yeah, baby.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Let go of me.
I just want to know, that's all.
Baby, don't do this --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
That's all you've got to say?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George...
But what?
Thank you.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
I don't know what to...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Sit down.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
I mean, how did that happen?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.

I'll call you back...
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Somebody's mother.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Steve?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what's wrong.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
-- Yeah, honey...
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
He does?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
Do you feel bad?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
All right.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Yes.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Advocaat is it?
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Sure.
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
What line of work are you in now?
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Uh...huh.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
Which room was it?
Yes, I did.
Yes.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
All the best people.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
You're a real booger, you know it?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Sure.
Good.
Was it a prescription?
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
I told you!
No.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Well... thank you.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
And I'm tearful!
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
You did what?
Sure.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Tell me about it.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
Really?
Keep moving!
Give me a C.  A C!
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Bless you.
What did He say?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
What?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
You mean black people?
Deal.
Can do.
A what?
No food.  Not until sundown.
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
My what?
Your cell.  Your room.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Useless distractions.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Come, Sister.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Saving you.  Move!
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Like what?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I've been worried about you.
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
You won't even tell us?
What's the problem?
Yeah...
Which one?
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
That was exciting!
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
Excuse me?
... Brom Bones...
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
How could he?
Listen.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
I know.  Hold on.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
They have done nothing of the sort.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
In a way, yes.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Leave.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Are you well?
Yeah, I did.
Well, I hate him.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
Naw.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
You will? For sure?
Yeah.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I reckon.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
You better go get your things.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I never was no good with history.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Do you have family here?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
Okay.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
But they're all the same.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Hi, Auggie.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
You got it.
Every word.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
Sure thing. See you later.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
What difference does it make?
It'll never be finished.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Thanks for the tip.
How the hell did you get into the building?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I figured he had a right to know.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Just passing through.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
It was just a thought.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Yeah? And why is that?
Huh?
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
That's where the what comes in.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
Two or three nights.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
And started to run.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
None.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Is that your third question?
It is.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Well, it seems to me...
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
I was checking the cables.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
That's all he said.
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
I suppose you want a tip?
Wanna see my driver's license?
It's entirely mutual.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
You tore it again!
Then pull the emergency brake!
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
How can we?  We're broke.
You - you -
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Oh, he does!
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
And where's he going to be?
That's right.
WHAT?
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
What engagement present?
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
I'm fine.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
No fair guessing.
You betcha.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
I guess she's not in here.
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
Me too.  Bye now.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
About that roadhouse -
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
Well - nobody's perfect.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
And you'll be in all evening?
Better keep a lookout.
Then why did you take this job?
I'll say.
What's in Florida?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Your face is familiar.
That's very interesting.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
You're society girls?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
If it's at all possible -
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Is it that hopeless?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
So inhale!
Let's make it an even million.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You shave with your spats on?
Why wouldn't I?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, hello.
No, I can’t. We’re late for a dance lesson. I guess you’ll have to finish up later.
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Both.
I’m compulsive and weird?
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
I think that’s disgusting.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
Not dollars. Pounds.
Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
Make out with you for free.
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
You have more than one gynecologist?
Just drunk enough.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
That does it...
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Yes, mam...
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Goodnight.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Listen, Mama...
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
He can't get up, Mama!
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Tired.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
My head hurts.
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
I said -
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
And she's getting worse...
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Yes, hon?
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
Uhh... I don't know.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
How do we do that?
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Are you sure, Kenny?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
You bet, Terrance!
I sure did, Phillip!!
I know.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Don't call me dumb!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Anna...
It can't be.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
The device has stopped responding.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Look answer my question!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Good help is hard to find...
That's me.
10-4 good buddy.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
I understand.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Words to live by.
No...
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
So what's going to happen to you?
We have room!  Let's go!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Marry you?
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
He's in the bathroom.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
I'm from Akron.
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
See ya 'round Faz.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
100 years! 
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Don't say that about my mom!
You got a better offer?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
I don't want to play.
Who's there?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
No!
What ever happened to just bowling?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Look who's talking!
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Mine, and they never tip.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
Kinda tough on the butt.
The mental hospital.
Can I ask you something personal?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
No, I'm fascinated.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Sheila, please.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
I could let them go for ten.
You're here.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
We would have sooner or later.
Did you - kill him?
I feel sick.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Sez you!
Your time is up, busyboy.
Open it, Captain!
I can't see...
Back away then.
What do we use for defense?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, don't do it!
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
How drastic?
She should've known better.
When was this?
-- and then brought her down here --
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Pull it.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
In a minute, sir.
The what?
You don't know that.
What's the message?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
I'm in charge.
That's quite a secret.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Get this thing off me.
The library.
My gosh, Norman.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
What do you mean -- not normal?
And you didn't tell anyone?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Eggs.
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
What?
Beth --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
A synthetic opium analogue.
Bingo.
It's a soporific.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Three to six hours.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
Did you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
You're lying --
But --
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Get away --
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Not a clue.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
It's like...
You don't understand about the sphere.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
Her suit's gone.
That's right.
I'm trying.  There.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Do you?
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
Captain who?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
What report?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
I don't know.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
I'll make a report later.
Send one squad up.
Was this trip really necessary?
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Did it occur to you they might find us?
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Hey, check it.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
A funeral.
Yeah.
Excuse me...!
Carl can wait.
I'll go for that.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
Yes, ma'am !
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You saying you didn't ?
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
What ?
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
I won't quit !
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
You can never be sure.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Departure angle.
A tractor beam...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Any reply from them?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Nope.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's in your play.
Yes...
But, but but but...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Mister White is...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
I <u>can</u>?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Read the card.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Oh.
...because if you don't, they die...
You believe that?
It used to be the Old Mill.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
I told them what you said about the script...
What?
Yes...
Now you're talking...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
I saw...
I'm going to tell the truth.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Ten thousand dollars.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
And I need a drink.
She wasn't in the...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
We've got three days to...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Just him and me.
Could I see it please...?
Nobody.
Get him on the...
Why?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
...wants a piece...
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Arrest him.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
A witness to what...?
It burnt down.
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
You want me to lie.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
...would you excuse me, please...
What did you say to them...?
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
If you do the product placement...
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
You think so?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
During sex.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
This is my house too!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
But Rache...
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
That's nice Ben.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Mom...?
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Let's take our best shot.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Get out!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
We can't live like that.
How's she doing with Brad?
It's the same choice you made.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
I think so too...
By way of saying you were unhappy.
That's not us.
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Nice to have you here.
Four brothers and five sisters.
I'm always working.
Jesus was not bad.
We're not ready!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Huh?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Uh huh.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Whoopee.
Oh.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Yeah?...
Because I'll be firing at them.
Where does it lead?
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Are you going to kill us?
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Good.
Get your men to do it!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
You know the regulations well, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
I know that, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
But we can't communicate with the base.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Quentin, how's your gear?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Why should they call us back?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Forget it.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Yes.
Yup.
A cloud?
Your a nurse?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
I'd get bored.
Watch out for that tree.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
No, no.
No. Life is too short.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Y- s-sure it did.
Wait. Hey, man.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Good. See you later.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Hey, thanks, man.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
What about me? I don't have a car.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
We were?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
That chick, Erica?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Look, your trespassing.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
So you can give me more shit?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Name one.
Okay, what would you have done.
Mm-hm.
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
God, you smell like whiskey.
For a ride.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Just go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
So how's college?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
Please. Look...
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Would I get paid?
Yeah.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
I think I gotta go.
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
At least I have a point of view, you know?
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wayne Gretzky.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Yeah.
Well, I want to know what happened --
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hannah, we've...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Let it ride for a while.
Come on.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Well....
You'll be waiting for me?
Life can be beautiful!
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
I'll make it short.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
It will?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
It must be my new shampoo.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Why did she call me?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
We've missed you too, dear.
It's a good script, isn't it?
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Uh-huh.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Thank you.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
You'll like it here.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
What's wrong with It?
Come on!
Just follow me.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You think I made that up about the gun...
That isn't true! Max?
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
Right with you.
You say the cutest things.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
But what will happen?
Eliminate her.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
That makes it worse.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
What?
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I'll drink to that.
And you think you're in love.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Yeah.
What about my proposal?
The scoop of the year!
Did anybody notice you?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Where is Earth?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I'd love to.
What? Me?
Sure. Mate in five moves.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Not yet.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
But Lana, you could --
Oh...I came close once.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Anyday...
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Who gets it, the company?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
First question got to be "Where."
Just the man I wanted to see!
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
For what?
What will it do?
Everything.
Can you do that?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
You just did, with that great dinner.
But the bridge...
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Don't cry, Bubba.
We can get to work on that oil!
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
It's beautiful.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
I asked the right question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
To ski?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Zod.  Zod.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
And I will lead.
Stay. I will come to you.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I'm sorry to see you go.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
I'm sorry.
Absolutely!
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
A toupee that flies?
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
You're a great architect, Albert.
We're running out of smoke.
I know son, I know...
I will.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
It wasn't a trick!
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
What are you doing here?
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Tough guy, huh?
I read the article.
Bingo!
Ready.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Then -
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
You think they're strange?
It's not bad.
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
On radio waves?
Yes...fine.
Which one?
But you said...
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Yeah.
Billy, please.  The children.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Yes.
From what?
What's that, Dolores?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Should I keep reading?
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I'm absolutely positive.
Tell me about it.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Yes.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Yes.
Why not?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Okay.
I don't know.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
Yeah, right.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
We're on our way there now...
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Give me a chance --
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Why?
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll listen one more minute.
No, I won't...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt...
And who's feet is she on now?
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Don't go wild, Sidney.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
- He's got them on him.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Yeah!
What kind of an act is this?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
No way!
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
What does that mean?
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Cool.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
Open the goddamn door!
Then what?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
Please continue...
Relax now, Sarah --
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That is correct.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Who warned you?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
What telegram?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
How could I know what's in the archive?
How could I forget?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
When you got to the crescendo.
They said I was dogged?
First oboe.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
I thought you did.
Kyle.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Molecular-memory.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
No.  I'm not.
A girl.  You know.
No.  Never.
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I just called.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Then, you kiss his ass.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
A game?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Why... ?
I think not.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Okay.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
You?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Guess you missed it.
Fuck you.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I saw them kill him!
Let me show you...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Studied acting, I assume?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Which grad-school?
Really?
It doesn't matter...
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Yes.
Don't take another step.
Hm?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
I'm not sure.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Friend... why don't you back off.
You know you can.
What about the house?
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
Who's Watts?
All night?
-- how much is this car worth?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Yes.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Why?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
It's okay... we're all here...
How could you do this to people?
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
That depends.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Well?
Am I a thing?
It's not a compliment.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Because --
Not bad.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Snuffed her.
Terry Valentine.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
What?
First in, first out, that's me.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Ashamed.
Modelling.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Black market during the war.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
All of what?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
No kidding.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Could do, yeah.
Yeah.
Five thousand.
I got half.
The L.A.P.D.
That don't mean nothin'.
So what.
Like what.
What's in it?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
What do you think?
Since when?
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
Tell you ...
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
It's OK...
I don't understand.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
All right, I guess.
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
Uh-huh.
So you paid the guy?
What kind of man *are* you?
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
I knew we'd pay for it.
Yeah.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
That's very generous.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
My *wife*?
He's the dead guy.
Yeah--
Ah.
They sent us to tell ya.
It better be good.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Yes.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
May I see that?
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
You must.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Don't stop now.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
He's right.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
What is it?
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Holy mother, what is that?
What?
Frock's been fired.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Gone.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I have to shoot.
<i>Fiji.</i>
It's the busy season.
That's right.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Thank you.
Of course.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
That's right.  Lauren.
I...I can't.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Really?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Well, I made it through another night.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Things always do--when you look back.
Well, thank you for your help.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
I'd ask for identification.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Evidence of what?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Show you right on a map.
And one little boy.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
A plague?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
It's locked?
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
Mulder --
Very weird.
For the purpose of what?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
I think... something stung me.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
On whose orders?
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What do you mean, walked?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
A pocketful of rye...
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
How hard could it be...?
Do you think that's funny?
Yes.  I am.
Good for them.
I got it.
He's beautiful...
Already there.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
What about narcotics?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Oh, yes, yes.
His own doctor?
He was Harry's driver?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why?
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
What's the matter?
A parrot...Let it go.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Oh, well.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Of course.
They'll be returned, miss.
What are you trying to say?
It wasn't petrol.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
This is where he vanished.
No.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Never heard of him.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
It's good to see you, Holly.
Why not?
You've got plenty of contacts.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
Coffee.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
The Roumanian?
Well make it your business.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Okay.
Help you out?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
There is one problem.
Yes.
A bit fucking late.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Swim?
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
It's just the sky, Richard.
No one follows that midrash.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
He's an asshole.
Then I won't bring you....
Yes.
Why the fuck not?
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Bigger and better.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Why?
I'm good at languages.
What assholes.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
You shouldn't.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
What'd you say?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
And? WHat did you notice?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
No.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
How did you...?
But I wasn't.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Steve's going to explain it.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
I've got to get back to the --
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
You could do it.
Get out of here....
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
I have an idea....
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Get out of my way.
I can tell....
How?
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
Dennis Leary.
Obviously.
We think you'd be good at it.
I was just trying to make a point. If --
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Of course.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
I said that the file is incomplete.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
No.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
How many are, down there?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Try speaking to me?
Fine!
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Not at all!
What?
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
... Yes.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
... Okay.  I'll try.
You go back, I'll walk.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
He doesn't hear too well.
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
... Sally?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Way past it.
Yes... It's magic.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
It's Esther.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
I want him to lock me up.
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
The elderly man I told you about.
Let me see it ——
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
That's right, of course.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
More or less.
Some crazy guy.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Just barely possible - - yes.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
No. He was kidding Charlie.
That's easy. Me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Yeah.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
And that is the last time any...
There’s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
Excuse me?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
No!
Leon hung himself...
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
I don’t.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t understand.
The dead can wait.
Can you tell me how you spell...
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I know where to look.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
Don’t fall asleep with your hair wet.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
Then find another way.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
What...?
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
Where?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
I hope it’s not too significant.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
You seem very sure about that.
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
At what time will you be available?
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Alors quoi?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Why did you kill him?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
What sums?
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
Cost what?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
That's a good idea, sire.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
I thought you were an archer?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Well...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I tried to.
I don't remember.  Maybe.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Last night.
Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
That's not a lot.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Yes, but...
Here -- take this instead.
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
I -- I -- I...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
Why not?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I agree...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
What are you doing on the wall?
No, I...
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Yes...
Let's see.
Jeanne, be patient.
Who wants me to stop?
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
I'll see you...soon.
He'll be back before curfew.
Just over a year.
Dead.
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
That makes a change.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
What did you pay him?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Where are we going?
God forbid!
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I miss you.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Yes
What for?
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
Yes, I thought that.
I don't want to learn.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
It's quite safe, they are managing...
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
Here.
I had some appointments.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
Which one?
They workin' for anybody?
What do ya want the others to get?
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Yeh.
That's why he won't know it.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
Where you goin'?
Yeh, this time anyway.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
And you were gonna pay me back?
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Let me talk to him.
How am I gonna do that?
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
No.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Never heard of the place.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Come on, gimme a break.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Another young man.
That is, if it's all right with you.
I can't.
Go!
Do you think I care
You're high enough.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
There!
He wouldn't say.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
You see how much we have to say.
Yes, she would.
A new invention?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
And he still wants to marry me!
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
What'd he think it was to you?
Keep on asking.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Who're you calling?
Nunheim!
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
I'll take care of him.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
I know.
Chris!
Chris -- Chris -- !
So I see.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
I never had it.
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Well, let me do that for you.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
They'll want more than your word for that.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Oh, this is Andy --
You got types?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Room service, please -
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
At breakfast.
Yeah.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I don't know.
Catch me letting you go alone!
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
He was down in the shop.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What things made you so sure?
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Why not?
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
I'm fired.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Wha...
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
So we wait.
He...he could have been watching us.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Get out of my way.
I out rank you, that's why.
Wes--
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
I have to answer him.
What are you doing?
Another month in this desert and I might just.
There might be.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Wait.  Wait.
You can't tell anybody about this.
...I know.
I got that...sir.
Mine.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Probably.
And then what?
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Shi'ites, I think.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
A headache?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
You will.  You'll get it.
What?
Like I said; so?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
How the hell should I know how much?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Then lets go back while we still can.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
We have to do something.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Correct.  Origin?
What's the matter with you?
Eat your dinner.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
It's 3+27 hundred
Don't take anything.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
They don't know.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
Look more closely.
I don't know.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
Look more closely.
Where are they?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Now wait just a fucking-
I don't know. You tell me?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Yep.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Where you guys at?
Would you?
Me, too.
Stay to your left.
What... ?
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Stay here.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
What kind of bomb was it?
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, Baron.
Thank you.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
I know it!
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Thank you!
No--proud. Very proud!
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Monescu!
Last year? It can't be that long.
What?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Yes.
You like that statue?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
What's wrong now?
What shade of powder do you use?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Yes!
Hair?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I'm crazy about you!
On the night table.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
But it could have been glorious.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Yes, madame!
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Didn't you take it with you?
An hour, two at most.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
I felt like black.
What do I tell your mother?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
No, but we're making excellent time.
No you won't.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
No.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Just move with me. Don't think.
Sssshh. Come here.
That's enough.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by!
Never eat before the show.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
But--
I think we ought to walk.
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
What do you know about them?
You can live that down, can't you?
What's the matter?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
No, sir?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Sure.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
I was never stiffer in my life.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Do what--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Good night!
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
What!--are you crazy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Oh, so that's it...
Not now.  I don't have time.
I don't understand.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
In pace requiescat.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
I was kidding about that.
Not exactly...
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Ignore her?
I'll remember you said that.
Revenge?  For what?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
All right, Doc...
A which?
What?  But I saw 'em-
Awful lot of money.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
What was that all about?
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
You'd die for fun?
Room service.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.
Sure...
Acquired?
You'll never make that stick.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Admiral, are you suggesting -
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
I appreciate your time -
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Just hold me.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Political considerations?
Fishing?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Step into my office.
She married a hockey player.
Depends what number you write.
... Kids?
You too.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Sidney Winch.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
- You're not.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
My father left me the business.
Trust me.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
You leave me no alternative.
No -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Approaching the first gate.
It's Bond!
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
How old are you?
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
No, I'm too hot now.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
How is the garden doing?
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
That's nice.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Okay.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
What?  What is it?
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Shield your eyes!
Shhh!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Everyone, it's Woody!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
I was close to being scared that time.
He got it, Woody!
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
There's no mirror.
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I carried you up to your bed.
She got away.
Living with him put years on me.
I finished it off.
Can you move over a wee bit?
In my pocket.
It was only a mouthful!
You're late for breakfast.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I can't do that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Caroline --
I don't know.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Yeah.
I get A's.  All A's.
Nope.
Depends who it's from.
Arizona.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
When will you do it?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
Yes, sir!
Fine, then we don't have deal.
I don't know.  Something.
The police won't find your car.
This is a very different proposition.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
Like you protected Landry?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Diane.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Ssshh!
Is that a promise, then?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Happy birthday.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Eh? How's that?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
Now remember --
You don't know, do you?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
What?
You know.
It was my fucking television.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
That's hardly a substitute.
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Six weeks and no sex?
Homeless people?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Raise shields.
I don't have a clue.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Let us explore it together.
Join my quest.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
And that is?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I've always known... I'll die alone.
Yes, Spock?
Goodnight, Bones.
But he does seem familiar?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
He did have pointed ears.
Hmmm?
Fire the rockets!
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'll take you to the bridge.
I don't control minds. I free them.
You are mad!

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I don't understand...
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
I mean I want both of us to go.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Wrote the...?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Then...
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Why is everything...like this?
I'm shocked.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Son of a bitch!
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
I still don't believe it.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
No!  Never!
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
What did you tell him?
I'll handle it.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
Would you say he was boring, then?
What?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Yes.  Go ahead.
Yes.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
The letter he sent.
And here we are.
I love to get pie after a movie.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What's your favorite color?
What kinda music do you like?
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Thank you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
Write down Drexl's address.
You don't know him -
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
... was so romantic.
Take that shit somewhere else.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Is he big league?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Um, nothing, let's go?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
She seems very nice.
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
What makes you think I would do that?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
I give up. Who are you?
No.
They didn't tell me.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Sure. No problem.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
We talked him into it.
Not a tiny little vial -
You're no longer an extra -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Yes.
Meaning...???
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Underground.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Shot!  Who shot you?
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He no!
Maybe I do.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
One way, or round trip?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Open up!
It is morning.
Come back when the sun comes up.
We ain't got no Beck's.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
May I carry your package, Grace?
No trouble at all, really.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You've been around.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Beautiful?
You know what I want.
Is it pretty?
I can't.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
John, please--
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
I don't know.
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
What about him?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Grace!
I think I busted my leg.
No.  I swear it.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
A lot that means.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
What brings you to Sierra?
Just ran into a little trouble.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I need thirteen.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
SHUT UP!
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Two-hundred dollars.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
How about I pick one out for you?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You can't do that yourself?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
That a fact?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
You expect me to believe that?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I'm her husband.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
An overheated car.
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
You love her, but you hate her?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
What the hell are you talking about?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You believe that?
Yeah, but it was shot.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I want my car.
You got the money?
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
You're welcome, Grace.
Where you headed?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I didn't say it bothered me.
Thank you.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
You love him?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Walk away.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
What do you mean?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You already have.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
But we all need that too. Hold him.
'Cause I love you.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
But, in particular?
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Heineken?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
What was that all about?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Oh?
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Yes.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes. Is this David?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
Seventy-five percent.
I don't know what you're asking?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
That's not what I witnessed David.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Jeremy listen to what--
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No?
But what they done, they...
Like whores?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
You want... a free one.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Yup.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Letters?
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Duke.
But he was called...
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
About what?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
He got the boy's horse.
First one what?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Huh?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Yeah.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Yeah... you said that last night.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Easy, Bill.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
An' if I spot 'em?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
What was the money for?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Goddamnit.
Umm ...
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Business or personal?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Tell him we'll meet.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Nothing.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
You thought it was just.
What is the truth?
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
What book is that?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'm going to uphold that.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I...um...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
That happens.
Defense...?
Overruled...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
And what are you?  A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
I think I will.
And are they going to get it?
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
What?
No.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
Yes.
I just saw her.
Yes.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Yes.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
He won't talk.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
She is not my wife.
Do you live here in the hotel?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
You won't have to.
Who you are --
Dinner... and what else?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow night? Well --
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Ah, no!
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
Scottie --
You can't. You're afraid!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Do you remember where you were?
Why?
Oh! Yes! Here!
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
I enjoyed talking to you.
We have.
Shopping?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
The oldest living things?
I don't like them.
Knowing I have to die...
Where?
Home?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Where?
What else?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
It's all there. It's no dream.
Please let me go.
How long has she had the room?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It wasn't your fault.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
What a pleasant hobby.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
What.
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
Out. I've got things to do.
Yeah.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Oh?
I need a drink.
You're an asshole.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
You go home!
What are you doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Have you ever done this before?
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Alright. Let's do it.
Adam! Calm down.
It has worked.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
What?
I know...
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
I can't.
Good God...Good God...
Go ahead.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Boyd...What have we done?
Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
False.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
What? What's your point?
What?
I do.
I think so.
Sent it.
Florist?
Caterer?
What else have you forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Charles Moore for instants.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Problems?
Not padded ones.
Go down where?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Have a nice bachelor party.
That's sweet.
What okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. You.
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Call the police.
What money?
What does that mean?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just kills me...
What does that mean?
I just want her to be happy.
I don't hear it.
The wahoo moment?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
How do you know she's dead.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
"You Send Me."
I do.
A mutant species.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What's that?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
Come down.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
Then you won't forgive me?
Yes, sir. Good night.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Do they worry you that much, then?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Come with me.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Yes!
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Mother.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
What happened when he was 17?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Both.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...

Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.

Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...

Quite touching.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
...how ya feeling, boy?
Where is he?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Ask it.
Why do they go to War?

Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Why Albania?
I never won an Oscar.
Why would they want that?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
I saw it on TV.
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.

We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.

Of what?
Uh huh...why?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...but...
No.  You're right.
A proud tradition.
Watch me.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...

Please, no thanks... 
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
About what?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
You speak for me, son.
What'd you tell him?
What if they call him?
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
So you're hot on this stock?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Yes...
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Break it.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
...how do you know? You wish...
It's over you, Gordon.
I can't...and I won't.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Businessman?
About what?  About us.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Ok toots, I will.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
What do you mean?
No.  But once I heard...
Then why did you?
You think that'll help?
Almost.
The wives.
This really isn't a good time.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
You do?
And then you weren't there.
Right.  I'm sorry.
No.  No, I don't.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Shhh.
M-E...
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I think three...
It's Saturday.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
You are...
To make sure she's all right.
I know.
Promise?
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no.  It's fine.
Did you call the police?
What kind of whispering?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Tonight?
...Don't get all...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Sabotage?
Claire, please...
But I don't remember.
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
It's alright.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I had you sent away.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
She didn't feel them
'He'...?
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
Lie...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Always loved you..
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
Only you...
I do not understand...
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Rowan...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You still feel that crazy...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What's wrong..?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
A little wine...?
I love you too.
Your beneficence.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
You don't know?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Why not? Please - it would help me
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Yes - I suppose so...
No thanks - 
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Yes I can...
I'm your landlady
What's this all about?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
Get out...
I think you had better leave
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
Take a whiff of heaven.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
These are real, live women?
You go first.
Yeah?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
You mean they knew who I was?
Very funny.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
Are they okay?
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Interesting.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
He phoned it in.
I see.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
I know.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Yellow pages?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
And the child...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Unless what?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
I wanna go home now.
I said he did.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
In back of the garage.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
That's not your line.
You think that's wise?
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't...
You got something against cigarettes?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Shut up.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Put them all together and what do we have?
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
You need that real often?
I'll work on it.
What about the explosive?
My disguise.  And here...
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
I'm going to hit you.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
I know!  I know!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Thank you.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
I don't like to lose, either.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I've had some practice.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Yes sir.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Right.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Are you okay?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Who?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Shhhhh!
His will.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who??
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Sorry. It's important.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
So one of them got to him.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
They kid a lot.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
How long have I been here?
Two days.
But you can't.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I'm going this morning.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
But... You may not be well enough.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Where's my baggy pants?
Listen to me – Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
You'd lie to protect him.
Not yet.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
You shame yourself.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Yes.
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Ohhh!
Oh --
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh --
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh --
I knew you would!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
You're right -- I am a coward.
Yes.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But why?  Why?
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Ah --
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
This way!  Come on!
Imposserous!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
You don't neither --
Don't push!
Not nohow!
NO!
We do.
To Oz!
Emerald City!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Well, I --
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
No.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
...you should rest.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
A rope!
Could...could you come?
How would you know?
What do you think?
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Marvellous.
Washington?
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Mm hmm.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Cured, yes.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
You and me.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
What does this mean?  What does it --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
What is this place?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
What do I get out of it?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
How will you fix it?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
What are you talking about?
When can I see you again?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
That's would be me.
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What do you say?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
A piece.  Only a piece.
ALIVE.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Now wait a minute!
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Yes.
I promise.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Darling!
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Yes!... the laboratory.
This is the only library I know of.
Good.
What?
Break that old man's violin.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
You must be Igor.
The wockers with the knockers.
Just putting up some tea.
Must be the music room.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Why?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
All right -- where is she?
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Inga, wake up!
And look at this, Doctor!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Of course not.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Three minutes to go!
Do Something!  Stall them!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
